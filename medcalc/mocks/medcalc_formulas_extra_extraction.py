INPUT1 = "We describe the case of a 70-year-old woman who developed sudden-onset vertical separation of images. This occurred only when she specifically gazed at a distance. For example, when she looked at a plant, she saw a double image that was completely vertically separated, without overlap. The bottom image was blurry and with color but of a similar size. It appeared ghostly and almost transparent. She could almost see through it; it was diaphanous. However, it did not disappear with either eye closed. The blurry second-bottom image disappeared only with the closure of both eyes or by looking away from the object. Hence, there was no evidence of palinopsia or bona fide diplopia. This phenomenon occurred for both stationary and moving objects. A moving truck was experienced as two vertically separated images, with the bottom image described as blurry. She knew that the bottom duplicated image was not real. The duplicated image was of the same size and receded as she approached it, as demonstrated by the patient's own original rendition (Figure ).\nShe denied any visual field loss or scotoma. The color perception was preserved. She denied photopsia, micropsia, macropsia, or metamorphopsia. Visual acuity was not diminished, and she was still able to read and write with ease. She denied a headache or weakness of the arms or legs. She saw an ophthalmologist who noted full ocular motion without any subtle ophthalmoparesis on double Maddox rod testing.\nHer past medical history was significant for asthma and ulcerative colitis. Her medications included azathioprine, lansoprazole, mesalamine, and montelukast. Her mom had coronary artery disease and her dad had cerebrovascular disease. She was a non-smoker.\nOn examination, her blood pressure (BP) was 150/92 with a pulse of 71, which was regular. Her height is five feet with a weight of 185 pounds and a body mass index (BMI) of 36.1. The precordial examination was negative for a murmur and carotid bruits were absent in both internal carotid arteries. Her neurologic examination was non-revealing. Her gait station, cadence, and tandem walking were normal. Her cranial nerve examination was entirely normal. Specifically, the ocular motion was full without strabismus with a cover/uncover test and an alternate eye cover test. Accommodation was preserved without pupillary asymmetry, and visual field confrontation was normal. We were careful not to miss visual field neglect by sequential hemifield visual confrontation followed by simultaneous double hemifield confrontation. The rest of the cranial nerve function was normal. Visuomotor praxis was preserved with pantomime. No limb-kinetic or ideomotor apraxia was noted with coin deftness and transitive motor acts respectively. Ishihara plate color testing was normal. Power function was normal throughout and graded at 5/5 with the Medical Research Council (MRC) grading. Sensory examination was normal to graphesthesia and stereognosis in both hands. And deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and lively in the arms and legs. No dysmetria or intention tremor was noted in the arms. Heel to shin motion was normal in the legs bilaterally.\nA magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain shows a diffusion-weighted image (DWI) hyperintensity involving the left mesial occipital lobe; striate cortex, V1, spilling over into the adjacent visual association cortex, V2, indicating an ischemic infarct (Figure ).\nThere was a corresponding hypointensity on gradient echo imaging (GRE) in the region of V2 (Figure ).\nA carotid duplex scan was normal. A transcranial Doppler (TCD) with a two Megahertz crystal with the insonation of temporal, transorbital, and sub-occipital windows bilaterally showed monophasic waveforms with no high-velocity jets, which was normal. Due to the embolic nature of the ischemic infarct and a normal event monitor, a cardiac loop monitor was implanted to rule out paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. A transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study did not reveal a patent foramen ovale or any evidence of cardiac vegetations or intra-cavitary thrombus. The automated Humphrey visual field test showed a subtle and patchy incongruous right homonymous hemianopia (Figure ); the patient herself did not notice any visual field deficits.\nThe patient was defaulted to 81 milligrams (mg) of aspirin daily.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?\n\nMean Arterial Pressure (MAP): MAP = 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure)"

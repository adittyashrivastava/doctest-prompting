It is revealed that he had a recent change in his medication regimen. On entering the room, he is sitting on the bed, alert, with eyes open and actively looking around. He immediately makes eye contact when acknowledged and is oriented to situation. He was able to recognize his treating physician and the emergency ward, spontaneously stating that he is in the hospital for dizziness. During neurological examination, he follows two step commands. His blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 58 bpm. Blood samples are taken for laboratory analysis, including a full blood count, renal function, electrolytes, and thyroid function tests. An EKG is ordered to rule out arrhythmias as the cause of his symptoms.\n\nWhat is the patient's Glasgow Coma Score?\n\nCalculate Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) by summing the results of the following rules:\n    Best Eye Response: Spontaneously = +4 points, To verbal command = +3 points, To pain = +2 points, No eye opening = +1 point\n    Best Verbal Response: Oriented = +5 points, Confused = +4 points, Inappropriate words = +3 points, Incomprehensible sounds = +2 points, No verbal response = +1 point\n    Best Motor Response: Obeys commands = +6 points, Localizes pain = +5 points, Withdrawal from pain = +4 points, Flexion to pain = +3 points, Extension to pain = +2 points, No motor response = +1 point"

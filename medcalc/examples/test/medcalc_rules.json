The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta.

At that point, she had a slightly enlarged liver with normal liver function tests and massive renal cysts. She reached ESRD requiring RRT in 2005 and received a deceased donor kidney transplant 2 years later. She developed progressive graft dysfunction due to chronic allograft nephropathy that required starting PD in August 2014. In November 2014, she was admitted to our hospital with a 3-week history of lower limb edema with painful skin ulcers, symptomatic hypotension and tachycardia (118 bpm), anorexia, nausea, and incoercible vomiting. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 70/45 mm Hg and ulcers with necrotic areas and cellulitis in the external distal third of both legs. Laboratory findings revealed severe malnutrition (serum albumin 1.5 g/dL) and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 288 mg/L; procalcitonin: 1.9 μg/L). A Doppler ultrasound showed bilateral femoral vein thrombosis, and so pulmonary thromboembolism was ruled out and due to the extensive thrombosis, a complete hypercoagulability state check was done, but no abnormalities were detected and tumor markers were normal. An abdominal CT was then performed showing large liver and renal polycystic disease, both organs with giant cysts (>15 cm). A giant hepatic cyst producing an extrinsic compression of the intrahepatic inferior cava vein (ICV) and massive venous thrombosis from ICV to bilateral iliofemoral deep veins involving the kidney graft vein was observed. The CT also demonstrated displacement and extrinsic compression of the stomach, pylorus, and duodenum due to another enlarged liver cyst, shown in Figures and .\nAfter the CT findings, we considered the clinical presentation was consistent with an ICV syndrome due to ICV compression and thrombosis. Furthermore, vomiting and oral intake intolerance with severe malnutrition were caused by a complete pyloric and duodenal collapse by the enlarged liver cyst.\nAnticoagulation therapy was started, but vomiting with oral intolerance persisted and the patient remained dependent on parenteral nutrition. Thus, percutaneous drainage and alcohol sclerosis of the compressive liver cyst was decided, with successful return of the stomach to its normal location, shown in Figure . Nausea and vomiting resolved in a few days, and adequate oral intake was resumed. Severe hypotension and tachycardia gradually improved, and a repeated CT revealed complete stomach expansion, as shown in Figure . PD therapy was modified but not disrupted, and 1 year later, the patient remained asymptomatic.

She was lethargic, confused, and was not answering questions appropriately for the past four days. On arrival, she was afebrile, and her vitals included a pulse of 139 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/79 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with saturation of 96% on room air. Physical exam was significant for a slow to respond female, orientated to self, who was able to follow commands with no focal neurological deficit. Her skin was warm and well-perfused with normal capillary refill, with no rashes or petechiae. The cardiovascular exam was significant for tachycardia, an irregular heart rhythm, and a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. She had lower extremity pitting edema bilaterally. Her lab results were notable for elevated white blood cell count (WBC) 25.2 x 103 μL (3.9-11.3 x 103 μL), hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL (11.3-15.1 g/dL), platelets 58.0 x 103 μL (165-366 x 103 μL), troponin 0.164 ng/mL (<0.010 ng/mL), lactic acid 2.5 mmol/L (0.5-2.0 mmol/L), and a basic chemistry panel was within normal limits. The urinalysis was remarkable for the presence of WBCs, leukocyte esterase, and bacteria with a urine culture pending. Additionally, two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Her electrocardiogram was significant for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate (RVR). She was started on ceftriaxone for probable UTI and was admitted to the hospital for further management. Further diagnostics included lower extremity Doppler ultrasound, which revealed deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A bedside echocardiogram indicated right ventricular strain, and the N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 8,215 pg/mL (<449 pg/mL). Due to concern for possible pulmonary embolism in the setting of known DVT, the patient was started on a continuous heparin infusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe aortic valve calcification with new aortic insufficiency. Blood and urine cultures returned positive for Aerococcus urinae. A transesophageal echocardiogram further confirmed moderate to severe aortic regurgitation with findings suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE), see Figures , .\nAntibiotics were expanded to include gentamicin with ceftriaxone for IE, and surgical evaluation was consulted. Given she was a high-risk surgical candidate, surgery intervention was not offered at this time unless evidence of further clinical decompensation. Additional surgical recommendations included re-evaluation after completion of antibiotic course. She was therefore discharged on intravenous antibiotics to complete a total of six weeks of treatment with ceftriaxone and two weeks of gentamicin. Soon after completion, the patient returned due to worsening thrombocytopenia that had previously improved upon discharge. On readmission, repeat labs were most notable for worsening thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia. The patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR and physical exam concerning for decompensated heart failure. Despite administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and heart rate control, the patient continued to decline, and her clinical picture was consistent with cardiogenic shock. In addition to respiratory distress, the patient went into ventricular fibrillation arrest. Due to the patient's wishes to not be intubated or resuscitated, she was made comfortable and passed away.\n\nWhat is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?\n\nAn 86-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and hypertension presented to the emergency department due to altered mental status. She was lethargic, confused, and was not answering questions appropriately for the past four days. On arrival, she was afebrile, and her vitals included a pulse of 139 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/79 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with saturation of 96% on room air. Physical exam was significant for a slow to respond female, orientated to self, who was able to follow commands with no focal neurological deficit. Her skin was warm and well-perfused with normal capillary refill, with no rashes or petechiae. The cardiovascular exam was significant for tachycardia, an irregular heart rhythm, and a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. She had lower extremity pitting edema bilaterally. Her lab results were notable for elevated white blood cell count (WBC) 25.2 x 103 μL (3.9-11.3 x 103 μL), hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL (11.3-15.1 g/dL), platelets 58.0 x 103 μL (165-366 x 103 μL), troponin 0.164 ng/mL (<0.010 ng/mL), lactic acid 2.5 mmol/L (0.5-2.0 mmol/L), and a basic chemistry panel was within normal limits. The urinalysis was remarkable for the presence of WBCs, leukocyte esterase, and bacteria with a urine culture pending. Additionally, two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Her electrocardiogram was significant for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate (RVR). She was started on ceftriaxone for probable UTI and was admitted to the hospital for further management. Further diagnostics included lower extremity Doppler ultrasound, which revealed deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A bedside echocardiogram indicated right ventricular strain, and the N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 8,215 pg/mL (<449 pg/mL). Due to concern for possible pulmonary embolism in the setting of known DVT, the patient was started on a continuous heparin infusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe aortic valve calcification with new aortic insufficiency. Blood and urine cultures returned positive for Aerococcus urinae. A transesophageal echocardiogram further confirmed moderate to severe aortic regurgitation with findings suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE), see Figures , .\nAntibiotics were expanded to include gentamicin with ceftriaxone for IE, and surgical evaluation was consulted. Given she was a high-risk surgical candidate, surgery intervention was not offered at this time unless evidence of further clinical decompensation. Additional surgical recommendations included re-evaluation after completion of antibiotic course. She was therefore discharged on intravenous antibiotics to complete a total of six weeks of treatment with ceftriaxone and two weeks of gentamicin. Soon after completion, the patient returned due to worsening thrombocytopenia that had previously improved upon discharge. On readmission, repeat labs were most notable for worsening thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia. The patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR and physical exam concerning for decompensated heart failure. Despite administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and heart rate control, the patient continued to decline, and her clinical picture was consistent with cardiogenic shock. In addition to respiratory distress, the patient went into ventricular fibrillation arrest. Due to the patient's wishes to not be intubated or resuscitated, she was made comfortable and passed away.\n\nCalculate CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk by summing the results of the following rules:\n    Age: < 65 years = 0 points, 65-74 years = +1 point, ≥ 75 years = +2 points\n    Sex: Female = +1 point, Male = 0 points\n    Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) history: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Hypertension history: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Stroke, Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), or Thromboembolism history: No = 0 points, Yes = +2 points\n    Vascular disease history (previous myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Diabetes history: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point",

History was obtained from the patient’s family and emergency medical services (EMS). The patient was in his usual state of health, speaking to his daughter on the phone, when he abruptly stopped talking and was no longer responding to her. This prompted her to call 9-1-1. On EMS arrival, the patient appeared to be convulsing, which quickly resolved, and he was then nonverbal but remained interactive. He was noted to have left-sided hemiparesis and was expressively aphasic. The patient was not on anticoagulants and family denied any recent trauma, bleeding, or surgery.\nInitial physical examination revealed a nonverbal, elderly gentleman in mild distress. He was aphasic. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 98/62 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), pulse 76 beats per minute, respirations 19 breaths per minute, oral temperature 36 degree Celsius (°C) (96.8°F), and pulse oximetry 99% on room air. Neurologic examination was notable for pupils equally round and reactive to light, left visual field loss with right gaze preference, left facial droop, and localization of painful stimuli on the right with absence of painful withdrawal on the left upper and lower extremities. He demonstrated left upper and lower extremity hemiparesis. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 18. Pulmonary examination revealed lungs clear to auscultation, and cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There was normal peripheral perfusion in all extremities.\nLabs were notable for point-of-care (POC) glucose 114 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (reference range: 65 – 110 mg/dL), POC creatinine 0.66 mg/dL (reference range: 0.8 – 1.3 mg/dL), POC international normalized ratio (INR) 1.0 (reference range: 0.9 – 1.2), troponin-I < 0.03 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) (reference range: 0 – 0.4 ng/mL) and complete blood count notable for platelet count 143 × 109 per liter (L) (reference range: 150 – 400 × 109/L). Non-contrasted computed tomography (CT) of the head was grossly within normal limits. CT angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck did not demonstrate dissection or a large vessel occlusion, and the patient was not a candidate for thrombectomy. Evaluation of the aorta was markedly suboptimal, with mild aortic wall thickening. The heart was not visualized in the CTA head and neck study. As the patient was within the treatment window, tPA was administered one hour after symptom onset for his right middle cerebral artery syndrome acute ischemic stroke.\nOn re-examination 20 minutes after tPA administration, the patient was returning to his mental baseline with improving neurologic exam. He was noted to be awake, alert, and talking to his family. Approximately 45 minutes after tPA administration, the patient had an acute change in mental status, acute onset vomiting, and was noted to be hypotensive to 61/46 mmHg. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) exam using point-of-care ultrasound revealed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, specifically right ventricular diastolic collapse (). He then lost pulses and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. TXA was immediately given to inhibit tPA-induced fibrinolysis and bleeding.\nCompressions were halted and pericardiocentesis was performed with 200mL of dark blood removed using a triple lumen catheter (TLC) kit. An ultrasound-guided approach with Seldinger technique was used to insert the TLC into the pericardial space. The patient subsequently regained strong pulses and began to wake up and respond to commands. Two units of uncrossed blood were then given to him. Cryoprecipitate was ordered but not immediately available. His blood pressure recovered to 179/117 mmHg. No epinephrine or other Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support medications were given during the period of cardiac arrest. Repeat point-of-care cardiac ultrasound showed resolution of tamponade physiology.\nCardiothoracic surgery was consulted, and they exchanged the TLC catheter for a pericardial drain over a wire in the ED. No additional blood was noted to drain from the new pericardial drain. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was awaiting transport out of the ED. During this time his family was bedside, talking with the patient. Over the next hour, he was treated with 10 units of cryoprecipitate. Approximately 3.5 hours after arrival to the ED, the patient again became unresponsive and was noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Point-of-care ultrasound showed re-accumulation of pericardial effusion and worsening tamponade physiology.\nUnfortunately, the existing pericardial drain was not functioning even after flushing the catheter. The patient again lost pulses and CPR was initiated. A second pericardiocentesis was performed by cardiothoracic surgery with removal of 800 mL of bright red blood. Despite removing the blood, the tamponade was not resolving as the re-accumulation was too great.

Associated symptoms included voice hoarseness, shortness of breath, dysphagia, and odynophagia. He denied recent dental procedures, upper respiratory tract infection or history of similar symptoms. Patient’s social history was negative for smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use. Initial vital signs were Blood Pressure 109/68, Pulse 101, Repiratory Rate 16, Temperature 98.1, and O2 saturation of 100% on room air. On exam, the patient was noted to have edema and tenderness to palpation of his entire right neck, with erythema tracking from the superior border of his right clavicle to the angle of the jaw on the right. No induration, crepitus or bullae were noted on the skin. Oral examination was remarkable for edema and erythema of the right anterior tonsil, without exudates or fluctuance, with mild deviation of the uvula to left. The laboratory values were significant for elevated leukocyte count of 29,000 with 89.9 % neutrophils and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 37 and 2.32, respectively. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck without contrast showed extensive edema in the oropharynx/hypopharynx, with edema and air within the retropharyngeal and danger space, as well as debris within the piriform sinus ( and ). Given the clinical exam, CT findings highly suspicious for “a gas-forming organism or necrotizing fasciitis,” and his laboratory results, blood cultures were drawn and intravenous clindamycin, vancomycin and ceftriaxone were empirically started. Otolaryngology was emergently consulted and the decision was made to immediately take the patient to the operating room for incision, drainage and washout.\nFollowing nasotracheal intubation in the operating room (OR), the right neck was explored laterally into the retropharyngeal space. Purulent drainage was found to track via an overlying necrotic fascial plane into the parapharyngeal spaces as well as inferiorly into the superior mediastinum. Intraoperative gram stain showed gram positive cocci in both chains and clusters, gram negative rods and gram positive rods. The antibiotic regimen was changed to piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazole (with discontinuation of clindamycin and ceftriaxone). Final wound culture grew Streptococcus anginosus and coagulase negative staphylococcus. The patient remained intubated postoperatively, and a repeat CT was performed on postoperative day 4 due to persistent leukocytosis. A residual phlegmon in the bilateral piriform sinuses was discovered, and the patient was then taken back to the OR for repeat right neck exploration, direct laryngoscopy, and bilateral incision and drainage of the peritonsillar space. Intra-operatively, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted to perform an open lateral thoracotomy to drain a posterior mediastinal phlegmon.\nDespite repeat drainage, the patient began to decompensate, requiring multiple vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion, and he suffered from persistent fevers, acute renal failure and transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase 4202, alanine aminotransferase 1922). His leukocytosis continued to rise, peaking at 51,600. On postoperative day 7, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest requiring one round of chest compressions and epinephrine before return of spontaneous circulation. On postoperative day 9, his multisystem organ failure began to improve and the patient was slowly weaned off vasopressors, with successful extubation on postoperative day 12. He was discharged to a rehabilitation institution on postoperative day 21 with a peripherally inserted central catheter line to continue vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole for a total of four weeks. On recent follow-up with otolaryngology six weeks after his discharge, he was noted to be doing well and has elected to undergo cosmetic revision of right neck scar, the date of which is to be determined.\n\nWhat is the patient's Centor Score?\n\nA 59-year-old Caucasian man with past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of increasing throat pain and bilateral neck swelling. Associated symptoms included voice hoarseness, shortness of breath, dysphagia, and odynophagia. He denied recent dental procedures, upper respiratory tract infection or history of similar symptoms. Patient’s social history was negative for smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use. Initial vital signs were Blood Pressure 109/68, Pulse 101, Repiratory Rate 16, Temperature 98.1, and O2 saturation of 100% on room air. On exam, the patient was noted to have edema and tenderness to palpation of his entire right neck, with erythema tracking from the superior border of his right clavicle to the angle of the jaw on the right. No induration, crepitus or bullae were noted on the skin. Oral examination was remarkable for edema and erythema of the right anterior tonsil, without exudates or fluctuance, with mild deviation of the uvula to left. The laboratory values were significant for elevated leukocyte count of 29,000 with 89.9 % neutrophils and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 37 and 2.32, respectively. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck without contrast showed extensive edema in the oropharynx/hypopharynx, with edema and air within the retropharyngeal and danger space, as well as debris within the piriform sinus ( and ). Given the clinical exam, CT findings highly suspicious for “a gas-forming organism or necrotizing fasciitis,” and his laboratory results, blood cultures were drawn and intravenous clindamycin, vancomycin and ceftriaxone were empirically started. Otolaryngology was emergently consulted and the decision was made to immediately take the patient to the operating room for incision, drainage and washout.\nFollowing nasotracheal intubation in the operating room (OR), the right neck was explored laterally into the retropharyngeal space. Purulent drainage was found to track via an overlying necrotic fascial plane into the parapharyngeal spaces as well as inferiorly into the superior mediastinum. Intraoperative gram stain showed gram positive cocci in both chains and clusters, gram negative rods and gram positive rods. The antibiotic regimen was changed to piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazole (with discontinuation of clindamycin and ceftriaxone). Final wound culture grew Streptococcus anginosus and coagulase negative staphylococcus. The patient remained intubated postoperatively, and a repeat CT was performed on postoperative day 4 due to persistent leukocytosis. A residual phlegmon in the bilateral piriform sinuses was discovered, and the patient was then taken back to the OR for repeat right neck exploration, direct laryngoscopy, and bilateral incision and drainage of the peritonsillar space. Intra-operatively, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted to perform an open lateral thoracotomy to drain a posterior mediastinal phlegmon.\nDespite repeat drainage, the patient began to decompensate, requiring multiple vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion, and he suffered from persistent fevers, acute renal failure and transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase 4202, alanine aminotransferase 1922). His leukocytosis continued to rise, peaking at 51,600. On postoperative day 7, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest requiring one round of chest compressions and epinephrine before return of spontaneous circulation. On postoperative day 9, his multisystem organ failure began to improve and the patient was slowly weaned off vasopressors, with successful extubation on postoperative day 12. He was discharged to a rehabilitation institution on postoperative day 21 with a peripherally inserted central catheter line to continue vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole for a total of four weeks.

She also had gastrointestinal symptoms, such as anorexia, nausea, and diarrhea later, and visited a local clinic on July 30. She was prescribed antipyretic analgesics and returned home. The following day, she developed a mild consciousness disorder and visited a local clinic again accompanied by her family. She underwent a magnetic resonance imaging examination, but no abnormality was noted. However, laboratory data showed leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatine kinase (CK) levels. She was transported to Kagoshima University Hospital.\nOn admission, she had a slight disturbance of consciousness [Glasgow Coma Scale of 14: E3, V5, M6], a body temperature of 37.4 °C, a respiratory rate of 22/min, blood pressure of 109/73 mmHg, heart rate of 97/min, SpO2 of 99% (room air), normal heart and respiratory sound, no swelling of the superficial lymph nodes, crusty bite wounds in the left inguinal region, although there was no tick. Laboratory testing showed leukocytopenia (total white blood cell count of 910 cells/mm3); thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 63,000 cells/mm3); mildly elevated AST (68 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (364 IU/L), and CK (317 U/L) levels; elevated ferritin level (1947 ng/mL); and normal CK-MB fraction (CK-MB) (4 U/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level (< 0.02 mg/dL). A urinary general examination showed protein (4+) and occult blood (3+). Electrocardiography (ECG) and chest radiography findings were normal on the day of admission (day 1).\nBecause of these clinical findings, she was suspected of having SFTS and transferred to the intensive care unit. Several hours after admission, SFTSV RNA was detected in her serum samples by RT-PCR, so she was definitively diagnosed as having SFTS.\nHer clinical course is shown in Fig. . Her blood pressure gradually started to decrease from day 2 evening. Fluid resuscitation (100 ml/h for 10 h; crystalloids 500 ml, colloids 500 ml) was performed until day 3 morning because hand-held ultrasound on day 2 midnight showed collapsed IVC (inferior vena cava). Then, repeat hand-held ultrasound showed recover from collapsed IVC; nevertheless, her blood pressure had not recovered and administration of low doses of dopamine and norepinephrine was started. To exclude cardiogenic shock, trans-thoracic echocardiography was performed and showed diffuse left ventricular (LV) wall motion depression (with an EF: ejection fraction of 34.4%), diffuse LV wall thickening, and small amount of pericardial effusion. Further, ECG showed ST elevation in the II, III, aVf, and V2–6 leads and a low-voltage complex in all leads (Fig. ), and the level of troponin I was elevated (120.9 ng/mL), but that of CK-MB was not. She did not have any chest symptoms. She met several diagnostic criteria for clinically suspected myocarditis [], which include unexplained cardiogenic shock, elevated level of troponin I, abnormal ECG and echocardiographic findings. In addition, she also met criteria for fulminant myocarditis [], which include acute illness (history of < 2–4 weeks since the onset of symptoms), hemodynamic instability due to cardiogenic shock, and need for hemodynamic support (inotrope). Therefore, she was suspected of having fulminant myocarditis caused by SFTSV. However, we did not perform coronary angiography (CAG) or endomyocardial biopsy because thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia greatly increased the risk of an invasive procedure. We screened for other viruses, including enterovirus, adenovirus, and influenza viruses that may cause myocarditis, but none of them were detected in nasal swab samples.\nOn day 5 of hospitalization, repeat echocardiography showed further LV dysfunction (with an EF of 27.9%), diffuse LV wall thickening (septum/posterior wall: 14.7 mm/13.5 mm), and narrowing of the left ventricular cavity (Fig. ). On the basis of these results, administration of low doses of dobutamine and milrinone was added. On day 6 of hospitalization, repeat echocardiography showed cardiac tamponade findings of the dilated IVC without respiratory variations and right ventricular diastolic collapse (Fig. ). However, no surgical pericardial puncture was performed, because there was no safe puncture space and a circulation agonist was able to maintain blood pressure. After that, echocardiography showed steady improvement of LV function (EF) and wall thickness, the urine output also continued to increase and the water balance gradually leaned toward negative as a result (Fig. ). Additionally, the pericardial effusion gradually decreased and the cardiac tamponade findings naturally disappeared. On day 11 of hospitalization, her mild disturbance of consciousness from admission had improved, and she no longer needed a circulatory agonist. On day 13 of hospitalization, ECG showed improvement of ST elevation in the II, III, aVf, and V2–6 leads. She was eventually transferred to a general ward on the same day. On day 17 of hospitalization, repeat echocardiography showed normal LV function (with an EF of 70.3%) and wall thickness (septum/posterior wall: 8.9 mm/9.4 mm) (Fig. ).\nOn day 20 of hospitalization, laboratory testing and ECG showed no abnormal findings. After exercise rehabilitation, she was discharged home on day 28 of hospitalization.\nShe had no history of cardiac diseases, allergy, or use of drugs that may cause myocarditis. During 28 days of hospitalization, CRP and bacterial culture were always negative, and there was no evidence of eosinophil elevation. Viruses, other than SFTSV, were not detected by virus isolation test.

From the time of onset, the pain was categorized to be severe, not colic and was localized to the epigastric region only. The patient was alert and ill, while she has had nausea and anorexia, but was not been accompanied by vomiting. Her vital signs were as follows: BP: 85/50, PR: 130, T: 37.2, and RR: 18. Her head, neck, and chest (heart and lung) were normal, and abdomen was fatty and without scarlet and reduced intestinal sounds. She had generalized tenderness with maximum pain intensity in epigastric regions, where her organs were normal. Her medical and corresponding drug history was as follows: antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, DVT, a history of two abortions, and type II diabetes.\nHer drug history included: prednisolone tablets, 5 mg: once a day; methotrexate: three pounds a week; hydroxychloroquine tablet: 3 days a week; and warfarin tablets: daily half a pill and insulin.\nFor further examination, her cardiac activity was monitored, and serum therapy was given to the patient. She was also provided a nasogastric tube, Foley catheter for urinary drainage along with hydrocortisone and antibiotics.\nAfter about 60 minutes, her vitals were as follows: BP: 100/60 and PR: 120.\nThe result of the preliminary tests showed WBC: 4200, Hb: 7.7, PLT: 80 000, and INR: 4.7 and other tests: normal. Ultrasound from the patient's bedside showed free fluid in the abdomen. Following these tests, the therapeutic intervention was continued as follows: serum, wo packed cell (PC) units, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) units. Meanwhile, the patient was prepared for laparotomy where, during the surgery, her sugar levels kept under control, control, stress-dose cortisol was provided, and she received 5 units of PC and 4 units of FFP.\nDuring the laparotomy, about 3 L of blood and clot were removed from the abdomen. Following this, a cystic lesion was observed in the vicinity of the large stomach flexion that bled due to the invasion of the gastroepyloid vessels (Figure ). After controlling the bleeding, the lesion was fully resected, and samples were examined for pathology (Figure ).\nPostoperatively, complete control of the bleeding was achieved with sustained vital signs. However, given the state of preoperative hemorrhagic shock, the patient was kept in ICU until satisfactory recovery was achieved. She also received 5 units of PC and 4 units of FFP, and the vital signs were maintained stable.\nDespite there was no recurrence of hemorrhage, she presented pancytopenia perhaps due to the underlying disease (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome). She was hyper-coagulopathic, due to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic shock (cause of referral); therefore, anticoagulant administration was not possible.\nAfter 24 hours and ensuring the stability of vital signs and the absence of Ileus, the patient oral feed was resumed. The postoperative examination for pancytopenia was as follows: WBC: 1500 (PMN: 60%), Hb: 11, PLT: 50 000, INR: 1.7, and K: 3.2. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) therapy was prescribed to the patients after which, her platelets and WBCs showed improvement. The patient's general condition improved, she tolerated the diet, and the bleeding was controlled. Her hemoglobin level did not drop, and therefore, she was transferred to the general ward.\nThe continuation of treatment was as follows: hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone: half a tablet twice a day, methotrexate was discontinued for 2 weeks, and folic acid and GCSF for 3 days.\nLaboratory results showed: platelet <100 000, potassium <3.5, and INR: 1.6. She was administered anticoagulant prophylaxis.\nNine days after the operation, the patient suffered from shortness of breath and tachypnea and a feeling of pressure in the chest. According to the history of the disease, the first diagnosis was a pulmonary embolism, for which anticoagulant therapy was immediately initiated and the patient was transferred to ICU. Her laboratory findings revealed: a decrease in platelets 20 000 and an increase in INR > 3 while ECG was normal. Anticoagulant therapy was restarted.

            "input": "A 60-year-old man presented with fever and productive cough for 2 days. He had a history of type 2 diabetes for 12 years and received peritoneal dialysis for diabetic nephropathy for 5 years. He also received antihypertensive drugs for hypertension for 10 years. There was no personal or family history of coagulopathy or stroke, trauma, chest pain, or illicit intravenous drug use.\nAdmission physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile (39.1°C), tachycardic with a pulse of 112/min, a respiratory rate of 22/min, and hypertensive with a blood pressure of 170/80 mm Hg. Bibasilar crackles were heard on auscultation. The peritoneal dialysis catheter was correctly positioned in the right lower abdomen, with no local erythema. There was no exudate buildup in catheter dressings. His systemic examination was otherwise unremarkable, with no tenderness, ecchymosis, or other external signs of trauma.\nInitial blood workup showed neutrophilic leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.8 × 109/L (normal reference: 4.0–10 × 109/L) and 82.6% neutrophils (normal reference: 50%–70%). The patient was anemic (hemoglobin 95 g/L; normal reference: 120–160 g/L), with a normal platelet count (181 × 109/L; normal reference: 100–300 × 109/L). Both his prothrombin time (PT; 12.1 s, normal reference: 10–14 s) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT; 34.1 s, normal reference: 20–40 s) were normal. Blood chemistry showed elevated blood urea nitrogen (20.5 mmol/L; normal reference: 3.2–7.1 mmol) and creatinine (1125 µmol/L; normal reference: 53–106 µmol/L). Blood glucose was 6.4 mmol/L (normal reference: 3.9–6.1 mmol/L), K+ 4.14 mmol/L (normal reference: 3.5–5.5 mmol/L), Na+ 145 mmol/L (normal reference: 135–145 mmol/L), Cl+ 108 mmol/L (normal reference: 95–105 mmol/L), and Ca++ 2.1 mmol/L (normal reference: 2.25–2.58 mmol/L). Liver function test was normal. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.40 (normal reference: 7.35–7.45), PaO2 60.1 mm Hg (normal reference: 95–100 mm Hg), PaCO2 44.8 mm Hg (normal reference: 35–45 mm Hg), and HCO3– 29.6 mmol/L (normal reference: 22–27 mmol/L). Chest X ray revealed patchy opacities in the right lower lung. The right diaphragmatic surface and costophrenic angle were also blurred. Furthermore, the cardiac silhouette was enlarged.\nTreatment for pulmonary infection with cefoperazone-sulbactam (1.5 g every 12 h) was initiated. The patient also received subcutaneous insulin (30 units/day) and oral nifedipine sustained release tablet (30 mg daily). Peritoneal dialysis continued with 2.5% low calcium peritoneal dialysate.\nAt day 3 post admission, the patient became disoriented. He was still febrile (40.3°C). SPO2 declined to 88% despite of 5 L/min oxygen via a nasal cannula. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.30, PaO2 53.10 mm Hg, PaCO2 58.50 mm Hg, and HCO3– 29.3 mol/L. Blood chemistry revealed that blood urea nitrogen (22.7 mmol/L) and serum creatinine (1345 µmol/L) continued to rise, and his plasma glucose also increased (8.4 mmol/L). K+, Na+, Cl+, and Ca++ were within normal range. His C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was 183 mg/L (normal reference: <8 mg/L), and procalcitonin 66.06 ng/mL (normal reference: <0.5 ng/mL). The liver function, platelet count, aPTT, and PT were normal. Thromboelastogram showed normal coagulation factor reaction time (9.9 min; normal reference: 5–10), fibrinogen reaction time (1.9 min; normal reference: 1–3), α (alpha) angle (64.9°; normal reference: 53°–72°), shear stress coefficient strength (19,233 d/s; normal reference: 4500–11,000 d/s), and hyperfibrinolysis (0.0%; normal reference: <8%) with increased platelet function (79.4 mm; normal reference: 50–70).\nThe patient was diagnosed with respiratory failure (type II) and pulmonoencephalopathy, and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and placed on mechanical ventilation. Imipenem (0.5 g every 6 h) was added, and low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin, 3500–5500 Da, 5–10 IU/kg/h) and insulin were delivered continuously by pumps. Peritoneal dialysis was discontinued and CVVH was undertaken at 32 mL/kg/h for renal insufficiency. The patient became oriented. Arterial blood gases showed normal pH (7.43), improved PaO2 (88.6 mm Hg), normal PaCO2 (36.5 mm Hg), and HCO3– (23.5 mmol/L). However, fever persisted (39.5°C), and the patient had difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.\nAbdominal computed tomography (CT) at day 5 showed a hypointense shadow in the left hepatic lobe (61 mm × 56 mm) with an indistinct border (). Liver abscess was confirmed upon ultrasound-guided drainage. The culture revealed Klebsiella pneumonia that was sensitive to third-generation cephalosporin and imipenem. Imipenem (1.0 g every 8 h) and metronidazole (0.5 g every 8 h) were given, and mechanical ventilation and CVVH continued.\nAt day 12, the patient complained left back pain, which improved the next day without treatment. Platelet count (243 × 109/L) was normal, but both aPTT (67.5 s) and PT (17.3 s) were prolonged; his thromboelastogram (heparin cup) was normal. No cutaneous and mucosal bleeding was observed. The patient had no hemoptysis and his fecal occult blood test was negative. Abdominal CT scan at day 16 revealed left iliopsoas swelling, about 61.7 mm × 64.1 mm, with inhomogeneous densities, and occasional hyperintense opacities and an indistinct border (). A diagnosis of iliopsoas hematoma was made. Anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin was discontinued and switched to ex vivo anticoagulation with citrate. Mechanical ventilation and anti-infection therapy (imipenem 1.0 g every 8 h, metronidazole 0.5 g every 8 h) continued. No improvement was seen, and 3 days later, the patient died after his family decided to terminate therapy.\n\nWhat is the patient's CURB-65 score?\n\nA 60-year-old man presented with fever and productive cough for 2 days.

The feet and legs had swollen first, and then the face and periorbits. Six months back, the patient first began to go down-hill. He developed dyspnea unrelated to exertion and a cough associated with daily mucopurulent, occasionally blood-streaked, foul-smelling sputum. He was fatigued most days and nights, and a low-grade fever had been present intermittently, but he reported no weight loss, wheezing or pleuritic chest pain. In retrospect, he was diagnosed with pulmonary TB in February, 2004 on the basis of sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and history of contact with a patient of active TB, received appropriate antitubercular therapy (ATT) for it; Tab Myrin-P Forte 4×once daily (OD) for two months, followed by Tab Myrin 4×OD for four months and Tab Vita-6 1×OD for six months; and recovered thereafter. Following that, his temperature was never over 99 F. Sputum was positive until July, 2004, and was said to have been negative after that time. He had no history of any other pulmonary illness, diabetes, or hypertension.\nOn examination at arrival he was nauseated, pale in the conjunctivae, febrile with an axillary temperature of 38.4 C, hypotensive to 70/40 mmHg, tachycardic with a pulse rate of 104 beats/min, slightly tachypneic at a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and showed signs of periorbital edema, facial puffiness, and lower extremity pitting edema. The lungs were dull to percussion, a few rhonchi over the right lung and diffuse, bilateral crackles were heard on auscultation. The infection protocol was implemented, including intravenous crystalloids, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy. There were no signs of joint swelling, any rash or discoloration, or evidence of heart failure or enlargement.\nEarly laboratory investigations revealed: hemoglobin, 6.9 g/dL with normal mean corpuscular volume; leukocyte count, 12.5 × 109/L; platelet count, 388 × 109/L; serum albumin, 2.0 g/dL; serum calcium, 6.7 mg/dL; serum potassium, 5.9 mEq/L; a markedly elevated serum creatinine at 271 μmol/L and an elevated serum urea at 14.3 mmol/L. Parathyroid hormone level was 146.9 pg/mL (normal: 10-65 pg/mL). Urinalysis showed protein (++), hyaline casts, and 24-hour urine protein raised at 3.7 g/day. Serum immunoglobulin levels were normal thus ruling out common variable immunodeficiency as a cause of secondary amyloidosis. Table gives an overview of the investigations. He was started on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and a one-off dialysis session after nephrology consultation.\nA single sputum smear was negative for AFB. A high-resolution computed tomography scan done about four months prior was consistent with bronchiectasis in the right lung, with no evidence of active TB (Figures , ).\nUltrasonography of the kidneys revealed bilaterally enlarged, echogenic kidneys with poor corticomedullary differentiation suggesting chronic kidney disease (Figure ).\nSuspecting amyloidosis, a biopsy was in order. The biopsy came directly from the kidneys, revealing renal amyloidosis (Figure ).\nSoon the symptoms became worse. By the third inpatient day, he ran a daily fever, continued to have a productive cough, raising from one-quarter to one cupful of sputum a day, and became hypoxic to the extent of utilizing 3 L per minute oxygen by nasal cannula. The third day of hospitalization saw a sizable drop in blood pressure to 50/35 mmHg, an increase in heart rate to 151 beats/min, and more rapid breathing at 30/min. Norepinephrine, vasopressin over titrating norepinephrine dose, and phenylephrine were used as a resort. However, the combination of all three vasopressors had little further effect. He was unable to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg, and breathed his last during the day.\n\nWhat is the patient's CURB-65 score?\n\nA 32-year-old male was admitted to the medicine ward with chief complaints of generalized body swelling and decreased urine output since two months. The feet and legs had swollen first, and then the face and periorbits. Six months back, the patient first began to go down-hill. He developed dyspnea unrelated to exertion and a cough associated with daily mucopurulent, occasionally blood-streaked, foul-smelling sputum. He was fatigued most days and nights, and a low-grade fever had been present intermittently, but he reported no weight loss, wheezing or pleuritic chest pain.

A diagnosis of bacterial infection was suspected and she was administered oral antibiotics like amoxicillin. Symptoms grew progressively worsen over time. Five days later, she was admitted to the same hospital for repeated fever and headache as well as bloody purulent stools. After treatment with cephalosporin, symptoms improved. Six days after admission, she presented a sudden left-sided hemiparesis and numbness, accompanied by intermittent convulsion. Urgent computed tomography (CT) showed an area of low density in the right frontal lobe. A further magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an abnormal signal in the right frontal and left temporal area. Magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) showed the left venous sinus were not visualize with collateral circulation extensiveness formation. Electrocardiogram showed frequent ventricular premature beat. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed thrombus formation in the superior mesenteric arterial hypoechoic. A diagnosis of cerebral infarction was highly suspected. After reducing intracranial pressure and anticoagulant therapy, no improvement was found with her consciousness and hemiparesis, so she was transferred to our hospital on April 25, 2017.\nOn admission, she was moderately emaciated, hypotensive, and her body temperature was 37.8 °C. She did not have any vascular risk factor. Her personal and family history was normal besides. Neurological examination revealed hemiplegia with a positive Babinski sign on left side.\nBiochemical tests revealed hyperleukocytosis (17.4 × 109/L), moderate anemia (hemoglobin, 88 g/L, hematocrit, 27.8%), hypoalbuminemia (albumin, 30.4 g/L), and elevated levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. A coagulation test revealed an elevation of D-Dimer. Antinuclear antibodies, including anticardiolipin, antinuclear antibody, antismooth muscle antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody, and rheumatoid factor were negative. A thrombophilia workup including anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid antibodies, homocysteine, antithrombin was performed and showed normal results.\nAfter admission, due to severe hematochezia, colonoscopy was unable to perform to determine the cause. At that time the patient was only placed on omeprazole (20 mg QD) for protecting gastrointestinal mucosa. In surprise, symptoms of hematochezia disappeared when treated with frozen plasma and erythrocytes transfusion. The anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; 4000 IU BID) was started, and DSA was performed followed, which confirmed multiple thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus with secondary hemorrhage (Fig. A). Interventional therapy with guide wire was administered simultaneously (Fig. B–D). After operation, the patient was treated with Warfarin Sodium Tablets (2.5 mg QD) and LMWH. CT scan (Fig. ) in 10 days demonstrated a residual left-sided forntal infarction. Twenty days after admission a follow-up MR venography showed partial recanalization of superior sagittal sinus, a filling defect of left sigmoid, and underdevelopment of left transverse sinus (Fig. A–B). MRI (Fig. ) at the same time showed infarctions in the left frontal and temporal lobes. Five days later, with clinical improvement, she was discharged home. She switched to Warfarin Sodium Tablets (2.5 mg QD) only which was withdrawn after a few days with no other recurrent strokes and a slow improvement of her neurological condition.\nThe patient received another hospitalization for recurrence after 1 year and a colonoscopy was taken (Fig. ), then ulcerative colitis was confirmed.

She denied any chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, or leg swelling. She quit smoking 36 years ago and has no family history of early cardiovascular diseases. She has a very distant cardiac work-up years ago, including a stress test and an echocardiogram, which the patient reported were unremarkable. Vital signs prior to the test were a blood pressure of 140/78, heart rate of 80, and a respiratory rate of 14. Physical exam was unremarkable except for a systolic ejection murmur that was graded II/VI at the base. EKG was at baseline with a normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and occasional premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).\nThe patient underwent an exercise stress test using the Bruce protocol and was able to complete stage 1 with exercise for three minutes at a speed of 1.7 mph and a 10% incline. The test was terminated due to dyspnea and fatigue without chest pain. She reached a heart rate of 141 beats per minute which was 98% of predicted for her age. She accomplished 4.5 metabolic equivalents of exertion. With exercise, she had occasional atrial premature complexes and PVCs with a ventricular couplet in recovery. She started to notice tightness in her chest. Her peak blood pressure at the time was 218/90.\nThe patient was transferred onto a stretcher, and an IV line was started. She was given sublingual nitroglycerin, 325 mg of aspirin to chew, and one 5 mg IV push of metoprolol tartrate. She then received nitroglycerin paste and metoprolol tartrate IV every 5 min for two more doses. At that time, her EKG on the stretcher showed ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 with ST depressions in leads III, aVF, and V1-V3 consistent with a lateral wall evolving myocardial infarction (). She was transferred urgently to our institution for cardiac catheterization.\nThe patient underwent an emergent cardiac catheterization with left ventriculography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) within 2 hours after onset of symptoms. Troponin-I levels prior to the catheterization increased to 11.17 (normal less than 0.05 ng/ml). The rest of the laboratories were within normal limits including a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. Coronary angiography showed nonobstructive coronary artery disease (pLAD 40%) and highly tortuous coronary arteries. IVUS of the proximal LAD revealed a minimal lumen area of 5.2mm2, and no ruptured plaques. Left ventriculogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and severe mid-cavitary hypokinesis with basal and apical hyperkinesis (Figures and ). To our knowledge, this is the first case of treadmill exercise testing-triggered mid-left ventricular ballooning variant of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, whereby obstructive epicardial CAD and ruptured plaques were excluded with angiography and IVUS, respectively.\nThe patient was started on medical management with standard therapy for heart failure. A follow-up echocardiogram was done two days after the event which redemonstrated mid-left ventricular ballooning, with an improved LVEF of 35%. The patient remained asymptomatic during the course of her hospitalization and troponin levels trended down from a postcardiac catheterization peak of 16.06 ng/ml.

IVUS of the proximal LAD revealed a minimal lumen area of 5.2mm2, and no ruptured plaques. Left ventriculogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and severe mid-cavitary hypokinesis with basal and apical hyperkinesis (Figures and ). To our knowledge, this is the first case of treadmill exercise testing-triggered mid-left ventricular ballooning variant of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, whereby obstructive epicardial CAD and ruptured plaques were excluded with angiography and IVUS, respectively.\nThe patient was started on medical management with standard therapy for heart failure. A follow-up echocardiogram was done two days after the event which redemonstrated mid-left ventricular ballooning, with an improved LVEF of 35%. The patient remained asymptomatic during the course of her hospitalization and troponin levels trended down from a postcardiac catheterization peak of 16.06 ng/ml. An echocardiogram was repeated during an outpatient follow-up two weeks later which showed resolution of wall motion abnormalities and an LVEF of 45-50%.\n\nCalculate HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events by summing the results of the following rules:\n    History: Slightly suspicious = 0 points, Moderately suspicious = +1 point, Highly suspicious = +2 points\n    EKG: Normal = 0 points, Non-specific repolarization disturbance = +1 point, Significant ST deviation = +2 points\n    Age: <45 years = 0 points, 45-64 years = +1 point, ≥65 years = +2 points\n    Risk factors (HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current or cessation within 3 months), positive family history of cardiovascular disease before age 65, atherosclerotic disease such as prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease): No known risk factors = 0 points, 1-2 risk factors = +1 point, ≥3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease = +2 points\n    Initial troponin level: ≤normal limit = 0 points, 1–3× normal limit = +1 point, >3× normal limit = +2 points",

She had a 2-year history of hypertension controlled by medication, and no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. She had an intermittent cough with white sticky sputum, without any other symptoms or signs. On the same day, the patient was referred to the Fifth Central Hospital of Tianjin. Here vital signs were: body temperature 36.2 °C, pulse 86 beats/min, respiration rate 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 142/85 mmHg, and she was fully conscious. There was no visible enlargement of her superficial lymph nodes. She had no cyanosis, percussion pain in the sternum, or abnormal respiratory movements. She had coarse breath sounds in both lungs, no pleural friction sounds, and audible inspiratory crackles in the left lung. Heart sounds were strong and regular, with no pathological murmurs in any valve auscultation area. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was 8 ng/ml (normal range 0–5 ng/ml) and non-small cell lung cancer associated antigenCYF21–1 was 13.31 ng/ml (normal range 0.1–3.3 ng/ml). Other biochemical indicators were within the normal range.\nThe patient underwent a series of imaging examinations (Fig. ). Chest radiography on March 11, 2020 showed several nodules in the upper and lower segments of the left lung (Fig. a). Chest computed tomography (CT) on March 12, 2020 showed multiple solid nodules in the upper and lower left lung (Fig. b). The nodules had irregular outlines, with a maximum diameter of 65 mm, and some had a central cavity. A diagnosis of lymphoma was considered. Enhanced chest CT on March 16, 2020 (Fig. c–e) showed multiple “cauliflower like”, soft tissue masses in the left lung, partially fused, with a maximum diameter of 71.3 mm and a CT value of ~ 36 HU. Enhanced CT showed enhancement with a maximum value of 60 Hu. The boundary between the mass and pleura was not clear, and the mass could not be separated from the pleura. There was irregular thickening of the pleura and no enlargement of lymph nodes. A malignant tumor could not be excluded.\nTo clarify the pathological diagnosis, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of the left lung under local anesthesia on March 16, 2020. After consultation with our own and other hospitals(diagnostics were performed by Tianjin Fifth Central Hospital, Tianjin Cancer Hospital and Peking Union Medical College Hospital), the biopsy specimen was finally diagnosed as BA according to histomorphology and immunophenotype.\nWedge resection with safe margins may be the best treatment option for BA patients. However, if the lung is full of diffuse nodules, the whole lung may need to be removed, which seriously affects quality of life. Our patient was treated conservatively and followed up regularly. She was discharged on March 28, 2020.Her symptoms were managed through regular normal activities of daily living, strengthening respiratory protection, avoiding respiratory infection, and drug treatment to relieve dyspnea and cough.\nTo clarify the diagnosis, a double needle lung biopsy specimen was removed, 15 mm long, 1 mm in diameter. It was solid and gray white. Microscopically, there were irregular adenoid structures in a background of fibrosis and inflammation (Fig. a). The lesion had a two-layer cellular structure consisting of a basal and luminal layer, and had a lack of papillary structures. The micropapillae occasionally formed by non-ciliated cells germinated and burrowed into the alveolar cavity(Fig. b). The luminal layer was composed of type II alveolar cells and club cells. However, ciliated columnar cells and mucous cells in some flat areas could still be identified (Fig. c).The appearance was similar to adenocarcinoma in some areas, with alveolar destruction and stromal widening. Through careful observation, we found that the main reason for the stromal widening was edema and inflammatory infiltration. Unlike adenocarcinoma, there was a lack of thick collagen fibers (Fig. d). Tumor cells lacked atypia, mitosis and necrosis. A layer of material resembling the basement membrane surrounded the basal layer. The most important feature was a continuous layer of basal cells around the luminal layer.\nImmunohistochemical staining for p63, p40 and cytokeratin (CK)5/6 clearly showed the continuity of the basal cells (Fig. a, b). The luminal cells and some basal cells stained positive for thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1. The luminal cells expressed immunological markers of the terminal bronchioles (CKpan, CK7, Napsin A and CEA). A small number of mucous cells stained positive for periodic acid Schiff. The tumor showed a < 10% Ki-67 proliferation index (Fig. ).

He had truncal obesity, a \"moon face\" and proximal muscle weakness. An electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy. His laboratory work-up revealed anaemia (Hb 10.7 g/dl), hypokaliemia (3.4 mEq/L), metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 35 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemia (170 mg/dl). A CT scan of thorax and abdomen demonstrated a dissection starting just below left succlavian artery and extending downward to the left renal artery, involving the celiac tripod and superior mesenteric artery (). The dissection was classified as Stanford B, De Bakey III. Moreover CT scan of abdomen revealed incidentally a left adrenal tumour of 25 mm of diameter.\nThe patient was pharmacologically treated and was felt at risk for impending aortic rupture. Therefore, an emergent endograft positioning was planned. Our goal was to exclude the damaged segment of the aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and at the secondary tears along the vessel). Through an inguinal incision, the right common, superficial and profunda femoral artery were dissected free. A prosthetic graft (Valiant, Medtronic, Sunnyvale, CA, USA 42 mm x 198 mm) was placed just below the origin of the left succlavian artery up to the diaphragmatic hiatus. A postoperative control CT scan demonstrated the correct graft positioning, not endoleaks and the closure of all secondary tears ().\nThis patient was evaluated for hypercortisolism and the plasma cortisol was increased to 33.9 μg/dl (vn, value of normal, 5.6-23 μg/dl) without circadian rhythm and not suppressed by the administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone (overnight text: 9.8 μg/dl; vn <1.8 μg/dl ). The plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was less than 10 pg/ml (vn 12-60 pg/ml) and 24h urinary free cortisol excretion (UFC) was elevated 465.6 μg/24 h (vn 26-135 μg/24h ).\nA MRI of abdomen was performed to have a more accurate evaluation of the adrenal mass, it was of 2 cm of diameter, well capsulated, hyperintense in T1 sequences with a normal reduction of signal in T2 weighted sequences ().\nA diagnosis of CS was made on basis of the endocrinological tests and for the presence of left adrenocortical lesion. Via laparotomic approach, a left adrenalectomy was performed during intravenous replacement of hydrocortisone, ACE-inhibitor, aspirin and insulin therapy.\nSix months after adrenalectomy, blood pressure was controlled (135/75 mmHg) with anti-hypertensive therapy, laboratory analysis revealed glycaemia 102 mg/dl, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 5.7%, potassium 4.26 mEq/l, sodium 139.7 mEq/L, plasma creatinine 1.05 g/dl, a.m. plasma cortiso l9.7 μg/dl, plasma ACTH 28 pg/ml and UFC 45 μg/24h.\n\nWhat is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?\n\nA 63-year-old man with history of hypertension and glucose intolerance since age 59 years was emergently admitted to our Institution from a peripheral Hospital for evaluation of a severe, constant posterior chest pain, radiating forward, and dyspnoea with a suspected diagnosis of acute aortic dissection.\nOn physical examination the patient was not shocked, his pulse was 87 beats/min, blood pressure 150/105 mmHg.

His laboratory work-up revealed anaemia (Hb 10.7 g/dl), hypokaliemia (3.4 mEq/L), metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 35 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemia (170 mg/dl). A CT scan of thorax and abdomen demonstrated a dissection starting just below left succlavian artery and extending downward to the left renal artery, involving the celiac tripod and superior mesenteric artery (). The dissection was classified as Stanford B, De Bakey III. Moreover CT scan of abdomen revealed incidentally a left adrenal tumour of 25 mm of diameter.\nThe patient was pharmacologically treated and was felt at risk for impending aortic rupture. Therefore, an emergent endograft positioning was planned. Our goal was to exclude the damaged segment of the aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and at the secondary tears along the vessel). Through an inguinal incision, the right common, superficial and profunda femoral artery were dissected free. A prosthetic graft (Valiant, Medtronic, Sunnyvale, CA, USA 42 mm x 198 mm) was placed just below the origin of the left succlavian artery up to the diaphragmatic hiatus. A postoperative control CT scan demonstrated the correct graft positioning, not endoleaks and the closure of all secondary tears ().\nThis patient was evaluated for hypercortisolism and the plasma cortisol was increased to 33.9 μg/dl (vn, value of normal, 5.6-23 μg/dl) without circadian rhythm and not suppressed by the administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone (overnight text: 9.8 μg/dl; vn <1.8 μg/dl ). The plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was less than 10 pg/ml (vn 12-60 pg/ml) and 24h urinary free cortisol excretion (UFC) was elevated 465.6 μg/24 h (vn 26-135 μg/24h ).\nA MRI of abdomen was performed to have a more accurate evaluation of the adrenal mass, it was of 2 cm of diameter, well capsulated, hyperintense in T1 sequences with a normal reduction of signal in T2 weighted sequences ().\nA diagnosis of CS was made on basis of the endocrinological tests and for the presence of left adrenocortical lesion. Via laparotomic approach, a left adrenalectomy was performed during intravenous replacement of hydrocortisone, ACE-inhibitor, aspirin and insulin therapy.\nSix months after adrenalectomy, blood pressure was controlled (135/75 mmHg) with anti-hypertensive therapy, laboratory analysis revealed glycaemia 102 mg/dl, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 5.7%, potassium 4.26 mEq/l, sodium 139.7 mEq/L, plasma creatinine 1.05 g/dl, a.m. plasma cortiso l9.7 μg/dl, plasma ACTH 28 pg/ml and UFC 45 μg/24h.\n\nCalculate CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk by summing the results of the following rules:\n    Age: < 65 years = 0 points, 65-74 years = +1 point, ≥ 75 years = +2 points\n    Sex: Female = +1 point, Male = 0 points\n    Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) history: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Hypertension history: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Stroke, Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), or Thromboembolism history: No = 0 points, Yes = +2 points\n    Vascular disease history (previous myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Diabetes history: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point",

He reported that he had a 10 L paracentesis one year ago. He denied a history of coronary artery disease. The patient also reported that he used alcohol daily and was an active smoker. The patient’s home medications included carvedilol, furosemide, spironolactone, atorvastatin, metformin, and albuterol. The patient’s vital signs were within normal limits. Cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur at the cardiac apex, however, jugular venous pulsation was unable to be observed because of body habitus. On pulmonary exam, the patient’s lungs were clear to auscultation in all lung fields. The patient had a distended abdomen with a positive fluid wave. The patient did not have lower extremity edema. His laboratory workup was notable for creatinine of 1 mg/dL, platelets of 33 x 103/mm3, INR of 1.1, albumin 3 g/dL, bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of >5000 pg/mL. The chest X-ray was unremarkable (Figure ).\nAt this point the etiology of dyspnea was thought to be related to congestive heart failure or ascites. The history of congestive heart failure, elevated BNP, and orthopnea supported congestive heart failure as the etiology of his dyspnea, but he had a normal lung exam, a normal chest X-ray, and no lower extremity edema. Meanwhile, the abdominal distension, positive fluid wave, and history of a therapeutic paracentesis suggested the presences of marked ascites. Large volume ascites can compress the diaphragm and cause orthopnea and dyspnea. However, management of ascites and congestive heart differ, and it was important to accurately distinguish the two (Table ) [].\nAn attending with five years of POCUS experience then performed POCUS to further assess the patient. Abdominal ultrasound revealed only moderate ascites in the suprapubic region (Video ,B), but no other significant fluid pockets were found in the bilateral lower compartments. This moderate volume of ascites made diaphragmatic compression as the etiology of his dyspnea less likely. To further characterize the etiology of the ascites, the probe was moved to the subxiphoid position to identify the IVC. His IVC was distended more than 2.1 cm with less than 50% collapsibility consistent with an elevated CVP > 10 mmHg (Video ,B) []. In order to characterize the etiology of this high CVP, the probe was then moved to the parasternal position to assess for cardiac pathology. In the parasternal long axis view, the left ventricle demonstrated normal ejection fraction, but the right ventricle was severely dilated, and a moderate pericardial effusion was observed (Video ). In the parasternal short-axis view, the right ventricle was observed to be larger than the left ventricle, with septal flattening during diastole suggesting severe right ventricular dysfunction (Video ).\nA paracentesis revealed 366 x 103/mm3 white blood cells with 61% monocytes and macrophages. The serum-ascites albumin gradient was 1.5, suggestive of portal hypertension. Finally, the ascites total protein was >2.5 g/dL, which confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac ascites. He was started on IV diuresis and had a 20-pound weight loss over the subsequent seven days with resolution of his shortness of breath and orthopnea.\nThe severe right heart dysfunction found on POCUS prompted a workup for pulmonary hypertension. A transthoracic echo confirmed the findings on POCUS including left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%-60%. There was moderate-to-severely dilated right ventricle with moderate-to-severe reduction in right ventricular systolic function. The right atrium was moderately dilated with moderate pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular systolic pressure = 60 mmHg). The IVC was dilated with less than 50% collapse with respiration, and a small pericardial effusion was seen. The patient underwent a right heart catheterization after aggressive IV diuresis which showed a right atrial pressure of 7 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure of 73/26 mmHg, mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 45 mmHg, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 13 mmHg, with a cardiac index of 2.7 L/min/m2 and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 498 dyn·s/cm5. His pulmonary hypertension workup included normal autoimmune serologies, normal diffusion on pulmonary function tests, normal high-resolution chest CT, and a normal V/Q scan. After ruling out secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension, he was diagnosed with Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension due to PPH. He was enrolled into a sober living facility and is being followed closely by the liver transplant clinic.\n\nWhat is the patient's HEART score?\n\nA 53-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure and alcohol use disorder presented to the ER with shortness of breath, abdominal distension, orthopnea, and a 20-pound weight gain in the prior two months.

On examination, she was pale and drowsy, but devoid of any focal motor deficit. Her blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, pulse rate was 108/min, temperature was 36.8 degree Celsius, and random blood sugar level was 112 mg/dL. Two months prior to presenting to us, she started experiencing recurrent episodes of vague abdominal pain, which would last for several minutes to hours and resolve spontaneously. Two weeks earlier, she had a similar episode associated with acute urinary retention, for which she was treated with injection furosemide, injection amikacin, injection pantoprazole, and laxative elsewhere.\nEvaluation in our hospital revealed anemia with hemoglobin of 9.2 g%, total white blood count of 10,300 cells/cu.mm, differential count showing 85% polymorphs, 13% lymphocytes, 2% eosinophils, and platelet count of 3.12 lakh cells/cu.mm. Peripheral smear study revealed normochromic normocytic anemia. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Her blood urea was 17 mg/dL and serum creatinine-1.1 mg/dL. Serum electrolytes showed presence of hyponatremia (Sodium = 103 mEq/dL) and hypokalemia (Potassium = 3.0 mEq/dL). Her magnesium was 3.9 mg/dL and phosphorus was 4.1 mg/dL. Initial computed tomography imaging of the brain was unremarkable.\nShe was euvolemic, and in view of acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia and hypokalemia, she was treated with intravenous 3% saline and potassium infusion. She was also initiated on intravenous phenytoin at a loading dose of 15 mg/kg followed by maintenance dose of 100 mg thrice a day for seizures. After 3 days of treatment, she recovered without any neurological deficit and her sodium and potassium levels gradually became normal.\nTwo days later, she developed status epilepticus again. Her electrolytes revealed sodium of 111 mEq/dL and potassium of 2.3 mEq/dL. She was again initiated on intravenous 3% saline and potassium supplements. She recovered without any neurological deficit. Her repeat urinalysis was normal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe and subcortical U-fibers, in which case, the differentials thought of were posterior reversible encephalopathy, extra pontine myelinolysis, and post-ictal changes. However, in the absence of an acute rise in blood pressure and renal failure, posterior reversible encephalopathy was unlikely.\nShe was clinically euvolemic. Hyponatremia evaluation revealed serum sodium of 111 mEq/dL, serum osmolality of 244 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality of 440 mOsm/kg, urine sodium of 88 mEq/dL, serum uric acid of 2.8 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, serum cortisol of 15 mg/dL, and thyroid-stimulating hormone of 3.5 mIU/L. She was not on any diuretics. Hence, a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) secretion was entertained. On evaluation, there was no evidence of any infection, organic neurological disorders, or malignancy. She was not on any antipsychotic therapy.\nDuring the hospital stay, she continued to have muscle cramps with severe spasmodic episodes of abdominal pain, which now subsided on treatment with opioids. Ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed sludge in the gall bladder, normal-sized kidneys, normal pelvicalyceal system, and a normal urinary bladder. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed multiple tiny gall stones. Serum Amylase (275.9 U/L) and lipase (486.4 U/L) were elevated. During this episode of acute abdomen, her urine was noticed to have a reddish hue, which did not further change color on standing. Repeat urinalysis did not show any active sediments.\nFor the management of symptomatic gallstones, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was contemplated. Meanwhile, she again presented with acute abdominal pain and was treated with opioids. During this episode, her urine was noticed to be of port-wine color, which aroused a strong suspicion of porphyria. Hence we proceeded with the screening test for porphyria, i.e, the Watson Schwartz method which turned out to be positive [Figures and ] Also examination under ultraviolet lamp showed pink fluorescence at 410 nm. A 24-h urinary assay for porphobilinogen (PBG) and aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was done and they turned out to be normal, probably because it was done after the acute episode had subsided. However, with a strong suspicion of porphyria, analysis of the hydroxymethybilane synthase (HMBS) gene encoding HMBS was done using targeted next-generation sequencing. It revealed a heterozygous missense variant in exon 13 of the HMBS gene on chromosome 11 that resulted in the amino acid substitution of arginine for glycine at codon 280 (chr11:g. 118963657G>A; Depth of coverage: 60×) (p.Gly280Arg; ENST00000278715.3). The observed variant lies in the porphobilinogen deaminase and C-terminal domain of the HMBS protein and has previously been reported in a patient affected with acute intermittent porphyria, thus confirming the diagnosis in our patient.[] She was started on intravenous glucose following which she became better. Anticonvulsants were stopped. She was advised high carbohydrate diet with added salt, lifelong. She is currently doing well and is on an OPD basis follow-ups.\n\nWhat is the patient’s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?\n\nA 15-year-old female presented to our emergency department with four episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures over the past 24 h.

Serum electrolytes showed presence of hyponatremia (Sodium = 103 mEq/dL) and hypokalemia (Potassium = 3.0 mEq/dL). Her magnesium was 3.9 mg/dL and phosphorus was 4.1 mg/dL. Initial computed tomography imaging of the brain was unremarkable.\nShe was euvolemic, and in view of acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia and hypokalemia, she was treated with intravenous 3% saline and potassium infusion. She was also initiated on intravenous phenytoin at a loading dose of 15 mg/kg followed by maintenance dose of 100 mg thrice a day for seizures. After 3 days of treatment, she recovered without any neurological deficit and her sodium and potassium levels gradually became normal.\nTwo days later, she developed status epilepticus again. Her electrolytes revealed sodium of 111 mEq/dL and potassium of 2.3 mEq/dL. She was again initiated on intravenous 3% saline and potassium supplements. She recovered without any neurological deficit. Her repeat urinalysis was normal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe and subcortical U-fibers, in which case, the differentials thought of were posterior reversible encephalopathy, extra pontine myelinolysis, and post-ictal changes. However, in the absence of an acute rise in blood pressure and renal failure, posterior reversible encephalopathy was unlikely.\nShe was clinically euvolemic. Hyponatremia evaluation revealed serum sodium of 111 mEq/dL, serum osmolality of 244 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality of 440 mOsm/kg, urine sodium of 88 mEq/dL, serum uric acid of 2.8 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, serum cortisol of 15 mg/dL, and thyroid-stimulating hormone of 3.5 mIU/L. She was not on any diuretics. Hence, a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) secretion was entertained. On evaluation, there was no evidence of any infection, organic neurological disorders, or malignancy. She was not on any antipsychotic therapy.\nDuring the hospital stay, she continued to have muscle cramps with severe spasmodic episodes of abdominal pain, which now subsided on treatment with opioids. Ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed sludge in the gall bladder, normal-sized kidneys, normal pelvicalyceal system, and a normal urinary bladder. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed multiple tiny gall stones. Serum Amylase (275.9 U/L) and lipase (486.4 U/L) were elevated. During this episode of acute abdomen, her urine was noticed to have a reddish hue, which did not further change color on standing. Repeat urinalysis did not show any active sediments.\nFor the management of symptomatic gallstones, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was contemplated. Meanwhile, she again presented with acute abdominal pain and was treated with opioids. During this episode, her urine was noticed to be of port-wine color, which aroused a strong suspicion of porphyria. Hence we proceeded with the screening test for porphyria, i.e, the Watson Schwartz method which turned out to be positive [Figures and ] Also examination under ultraviolet lamp showed pink fluorescence at 410 nm. A 24-h urinary assay for porphobilinogen (PBG) and aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was done and they turned out to be normal, probably because it was done after the acute episode had subsided. However, with a strong suspicion of porphyria, analysis of the hydroxymethybilane synthase (HMBS) gene encoding HMBS was done using targeted next-generation sequencing. It revealed a heterozygous missense variant in exon 13 of the HMBS gene on chromosome 11 that resulted in the amino acid substitution of arginine for glycine at codon 280 (chr11:g. 118963657G>A; Depth of coverage: 60×) (p.Gly280Arg; ENST00000278715.3). The observed variant lies in the porphobilinogen deaminase and C-terminal domain of the HMBS protein and has previously been reported in a patient affected with acute intermittent porphyria, thus confirming the diagnosis in our patient.[] She was started on intravenous glucose following which she became better. Anticonvulsants were stopped. She was advised high carbohydrate diet with added salt, lifelong. She is currently doing well and is on an OPD basis follow-ups.\n\nCalculate Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism by summing the results of the following rules:\n    Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT: No = 0 points, Yes = +3 points\n    PE is #1 diagnosis OR equally likely: No = 0 points, Yes = +3 points\n    Heart rate > 100: No = 0 points, Yes = +1.5 points\n    Immobilization at least 3 days OR surgery in the previous 4 weeks: No = 0 points, Yes = +1.5 points\n    Previous, objectively diagnosed PE or DVT: No = 0 points, Yes = +1.5 points\n    Hemoptysis: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Malignancy with treatment within 6 months or palliative: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point",

Pertinent abnormal labs include: white blood cell count (WBC), 14.5 units/mcl (reference range: 4.80-10.80 units/mcl) with neutrophils of 82.1% (reference range: 44%-70%), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 39 mg/dl (reference range: 7-18 mg/dl), creatinine (Cr) 3.8 mg/dl (reference range: 0.7-1.2 mg/dl), calcium (Ca) 7.7 mg/dl (reference range: 8.5-10.1 mg/dl). Chest x-ray showed a focal area of consolidation involving the left midlung. Patient was admitted and managed on the medical floor for sepsis likely secondary hospital acquired pneumonia especially given his immunocompromised state. Patient was started on IV vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam in the emergency department.\nDuring the course of the hospitalization, infectious disease was consulted and they recommended to start the patient on IV cefepime 1 g Q24 hours, oral linezolid 600 mg Q12H, and oral clindamycin 450 mg Q8H. In addition, patient was started on calcium acetate for his hypocalcemia and was continued on sodium bicarbonate 1300 mg Q8H for his AKI on CKD. After two days the cefepime dose was increased to 2 mg. Two days after increasing the dose of cefepime, patient started developing altered mental status. Patient was alert and oriented only to person, incoherent and expressed thoughts like “I would kill myself if I had the chance” so the cefepime was discontinued and within one day the patient was more conversant, denied any suicidal ideations and was alert and oriented to person and place. In addition, the BUN and creatinine (Cr) levels trended up to 41 mg/dl and 5.4 mg/dl. So the calcium acetate was switched to calcium carbonate and calcitriol. After making these changes the Cr level trended down to 3.4 mg/dl. In addition, the corrected Calcium level was at normal levels based on the albumin level of the patient. The mental status improved and patient was subsequently discharged.

She also complained of painful right laterocervical lymph nodes for 1 month. Her clinical history was unremarkable except for a hypothyroidism diagnosed in 2013 and treated with a daily dose of levothyroxine. She had no past history of tuberculosis or contact with it. On admission, her heart rate was 90 bpm, blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, respiratory rate was 16 breaths/minute, and body temperature was 37.5°C. Physical examination revealed two right nontender, fixed, and painful laterocervical lymph nodes. There were no hepatosplenomegaly or other clinically appreciable lymphadenopathy elsewhere. Examination of respiratory and other systems was normal. Laboratory analysis showed slight increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values that were, respectively, of 20 mg/L (n.v. < 2.9), 705 UI/L (n.v. < 450), and 54 mm/h.

Four months previously, he had been diagnosed to have Ewing sarcoma of the right ilium and had undergone five cycles of preoperative chemotherapy. He had contracted a C. tropicalis urinary tract infection during a febrile neutropenia episode after chemotherapy, which was treated with itraconazole and broad spectrum antibiotics for 7 days. No growth was reported in the last urine culture after itraconazole treatment. Recently, he had been on preoperative chemotherapy (vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide), which he had completed 9 days prior to presentation.\nAt presentation, his body temperature was 37.5℃, pulse rate 120 per minute, respiration rate 20 per minute, and blood pressure 130/70 mmHg. physical examination revealed a slight throat infection, but no sinus tenderness, nor tonsilar nor lymph node enlargement. Heart and lung sounds were normal, liver and spleen were non-palpable, and no edema or pain was found in the lower extremities. He complained of discomfort of the right elbow. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia, and complete blood count findings were leukocytes 160/mm3, absolute neutrophil count 40/mm3, hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count 8,000/mm3. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacilin/tazobactam and isepacin) were immediately administered after obtaining blood and urine for culture studies.\nAfter two days of antibiotic treatment, mild tenderness and swelling (without heating sensation) were detected on the right elbow.

On examination, he was febrile with 38 °C, in moderate respiratory distress, and had mild oxyhemoglobin desaturation (SpO2 of 94% on room air). Chest CT on admission revealed multiple ground-glass opacities and areas of pulmonary consolidation in all segments of the lungs (Figure ).\nBlood tests demonstrated an extra-high level of ferritin and noticeably increased CRP and aminotransferases (Table ).\nCOVID-19 was confirmed by a positive PCR test obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab. Because of a pronounced pulmonary involvement on CT and clinical data suggestive of CRS, the patient was started on methylprednisolone 125 mg IV daily, enoxaparin, lopinavir, ritonavir, umifenovir, and ceftriaxone. Despite treatment, during the first two hospital days, he experienced severe symptoms including transient elevations of body temperature to 38 °C with chills, cough, shortness of breath, dizziness, and insomnia. Blood oxygen saturation decreased to 85-90% on room air, requiring noninvasive low-flow oxygenation with growth in SpO2 to 90-92% on 5 L/min of oxygen via facial mask. The patient was fully conscious, complied with recommendations of the personnel, and was put to a prone-position for two hours every two hours.\nOn day three, he underwent a deterioration with severe dyspnea at rest, aggravation of fever (38.1 °C), and fall in SpO2 to 87% on low-flow oxygenation of 5 L/min via facial mask.

He had been diagnosed with disc herniation at L4-L5, and had been hospitalized for bed-rest and treatment. While hospitalized, he had received several intravenous injections of sodium salicylate, but no peripheral intravenous catheter had been inserted. About 2 months after discharge, he had been referred to our outpatient anesthesiology department because of ongoing leg pain. Two weeks before presentation, he had received his first epidural block using 6 ml of 0.8% mepivacaine hydrochloride at the L4-L5 level, injected via the paramedian approach. Two days before presentation, a second epidural block using 5 ml of 0.8% mepivacaine hydrochloride had been administered at the same level. The skin had been disinfected with 5% chlorhexidine solution prior to needle insertion on both occasions. His medical history included hypertension and diabetes, for which he was taking antihypertensive and hypoglycemic agents, respectively. He had no history of trauma, shoulder injection, subclavian vein catheterization, or intravenous drug abuse. He did not have any focal dental infection or signs of tooth decay. He was unable to walk, due to increased leg pain. The day prior to admission, he experienced a fever of 39 °C.\nOn examination, he was in moderate respiratory distress and mildly diaphoretic, with a blood pressure of 97/51 mmHg, pulse rate of 95 beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, temperature of 39.5 °C, and oxygen saturation of 80% on room air. His oxygen saturation improved to 92% with oxygen administration (2 l/min by nasal cannula). Examination of the oral cavity and pharynx was normal, and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Chest examination was unremarkable except for swelling and severe tenderness over the left SCJ. Lumbar spine examination showed stiffness, with tenderness over the vertebrae. Movement of the lower back and pressure over the lumbar spine caused pain. The straight leg raising test and femoral nerve stretch test were inconclusive bilaterally because of lower back muscle spasm. His lower limb muscle power, knee and ankle reflexes, and sensation were normal. Bladder and bowel function were normal.\nLaboratory testing showed the following results: plasma white blood cell count (WBC) 18,490/mm3, platelet count 541,000/mm3, hemoglobin 9.0 g/dl, C-reactive protein 22.9 mg/dl, fasting blood glucose 335 mg/dl, glycosylated hemoglobin 8.1%, blood urea nitrogen 23.7 mg/dl, creatinine 0.73 mg/dl, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 59 IU/l, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 62 IU/l, cholinesterase 134 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 600 IU/l, lactate dehydrogenase 381 IU/l, and creatine kinase 566 IU/l. US examination of the left SCJ suggested pyogenic arthritis with involvement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The chest X-ray was normal, and there were no abnormalities on ECG or cardiac US. CT showed erosion and abscess formation of the SCJ with extension of the abscess into the mediastinum (Figures A and B) and sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure C). Abdominal CT showed swelling of the left paraspinal muscle at L1-L3 (Figure A). MRI showed spondylitis of the L3-L4 vertebrae (Figure B) with a focal epidural collection and L3-L4 discitis (Figure C).\nAspiration of the SCJ revealed a turbid fluid (approximately 3 ml) (Figure ) with clusters of gram-positive cocci on microscopy. The SCJ was incised and drained, and the abscess cavity was enlarged to include the abscess of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sulbactam/ampicillin administration was started immediately. Aspirated pus, urine, and two sets of blood cultures all indicated S. aureus infection. According to the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing, the patient’s antibiotic therapy was changed to cefotiam. After one week of antibiotic therapy, blood and wound cultures were negative for pathogens. Follow-up MRI clearly showed abscess formation in the left paraspinal muscle at L1-L3, but culture of fluid aspirated from the abscess showed no growth.\nThe patient’s general condition improved significantly and his fever subsided after 4 days. The wound at the SCJ was irrigated daily. Twelve days after the onset of treatment, his plasma WBC was 7,050/mm3 with 78% neutrophils. Two weeks after admission, there was a still a non-tender swelling over the left SCJ, but the purulent secretion had completely resolved. Neurological examination of the lower limbs was unchanged.

He had no history of trauma, shoulder injection, subclavian vein catheterization, or intravenous drug abuse. He did not have any focal dental infection or signs of tooth decay. He was unable to walk, due to increased leg pain. The day prior to admission, he experienced a fever of 39 °C.\nOn examination, he was in moderate respiratory distress and mildly diaphoretic, with a blood pressure of 97/51 mmHg, pulse rate of 95 beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, temperature of 39.5 °C, and oxygen saturation of 80% on room air. His oxygen saturation improved to 92% with oxygen administration (2 l/min by nasal cannula). Examination of the oral cavity and pharynx was normal, and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Chest examination was unremarkable except for swelling and severe tenderness over the left SCJ. Lumbar spine examination showed stiffness, with tenderness over the vertebrae. Movement of the lower back and pressure over the lumbar spine caused pain. The straight leg raising test and femoral nerve stretch test were inconclusive bilaterally because of lower back muscle spasm. His lower limb muscle power, knee and ankle reflexes, and sensation were normal. Bladder and bowel function were normal.\nLaboratory testing showed the following results: plasma white blood cell count (WBC) 18,490/mm3, platelet count 541,000/mm3, hemoglobin 9.0 g/dl, C-reactive protein 22.9 mg/dl, fasting blood glucose 335 mg/dl, glycosylated hemoglobin 8.1%, blood urea nitrogen 23.7 mg/dl, creatinine 0.73 mg/dl, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 59 IU/l, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 62 IU/l, cholinesterase 134 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 600 IU/l, lactate dehydrogenase 381 IU/l, and creatine kinase 566 IU/l. US examination of the left SCJ suggested pyogenic arthritis with involvement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The chest X-ray was normal, and there were no abnormalities on ECG or cardiac US. CT showed erosion and abscess formation of the SCJ with extension of the abscess into the mediastinum (Figures A and B) and sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure C). Abdominal CT showed swelling of the left paraspinal muscle at L1-L3 (Figure A). MRI showed spondylitis of the L3-L4 vertebrae (Figure B) with a focal epidural collection and L3-L4 discitis (Figure C).\nAspiration of the SCJ revealed a turbid fluid (approximately 3 ml) (Figure ) with clusters of gram-positive cocci on microscopy. The SCJ was incised and drained, and the abscess cavity was enlarged to include the abscess of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sulbactam/ampicillin administration was started immediately. Aspirated pus, urine, and two sets of blood cultures all indicated S. aureus infection. According to the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing, the patient’s antibiotic therapy was changed to cefotiam. After one week of antibiotic therapy, blood and wound cultures were negative for pathogens. Follow-up MRI clearly showed abscess formation in the left paraspinal muscle at L1-L3, but culture of fluid aspirated from the abscess showed no growth.\nThe patient’s general condition improved significantly and his fever subsided after 4 days. The wound at the SCJ was irrigated daily. Twelve days after the onset of treatment, his plasma WBC was 7,050/mm3 with 78% neutrophils. Two weeks after admission, there was a still a non-tender swelling over the left SCJ, but the purulent secretion had completely resolved. Neurological examination of the lower limbs was unchanged. Eight weeks after admission, he was transferred to the spinal surgery unit to undergo evaluation for operative treatment of his spondylitis and epidural abscess.\n\nCalculate CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity by summing the results of the following rules:\n    Confusion: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    BUN >19 mg/dL (>7 mmol/L urea): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Respiratory Rate ≥30: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Systolic BP <90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤60 mmHg: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Age ≥65: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point",

Her activities of daily living had been independent before admission. On admission, her vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 35.3°C; heart rate, 86 beats/min; SpO2, 96% (on room air); respiratory rate, 14 breaths/min; and blood pressure, 161/78 mmHg. No skin lesions or peripheral neuropathy were noted.\nA laboratory examination revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count [WBC]: 11,900/mm), normocytic normochromic anemia (Hb: 6.1 g/dL), elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) level (6.1 mg/dL), and renal dysfunction (BUN: 42.6 mg/dL, Cr: 4.04 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed the following results: proteinuria 3+ (1.48 g/day) and hematuria 3+. The red cell counts in the urinary sediment were elevated (388 per high-power field). Serological tests for MPO-ANCA, PR3-ANCA, and anti-GBM antibodies were performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies against myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) and antibodies against proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA) and antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies were not identified, although these assays were performed several times during the clinical course (). Testing for hepatitis B and C viruses, and antinuclear antibody titer was negative. The complement levels were normal.\nChest X-ray and thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed patchy alveolar infiltrates throughout the upper and lower zones in both lungs (Figures and ).\nAn electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. Echocardiography revealed a normal ejection fraction of 60%, normal right-ventricular size, no evidence of a pericardial effusion, and no findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema. Abdominal ultrasound showed bilateral normal-sized kidneys with increased echogenicity.\nPneumonia was suspected on admission and several antibiotics were initiated based on an increase in inflammatory reaction including WBC and CRP levels. However, as alveolar patchy infiltrates gradually expanded after admission (Figures , , and ) and she expectorated bloody sputum on the 3rd day, we evaluated these antibiotic drugs as ineffective and she was treated with a blood transfusion because of worsening of anemia.\nTo determine the causative organism, culture tests were performed for sputum culture five times and blood culture three times over the course of hospitalization; however, no bacterial species causing pneumonia were detected. Serological tests for Cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma, and fungus were also negative. No infectious explanation for these imaging findings was found.\nOn the 10th day, as the oxygen saturation fell to 82% despite the administration of oxygen (10 liters per minute) by face mask, she was moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation was begun. Her renal function worsened with serum creatinine increasing steadily from 4.04 mg/dL on admission to a peak of 5.76 mg/dL on the 9th day. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) was diagnosed by urinary findings and progressive loss of renal function. As there had been no urine output on the 9th day, a hemodialysis catheter was placed, and hemodiafiltration (HDF) was begun.\nThe findings of chest X-ray and chest CT scan indicated the more specific group of disorders known as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage accompanied by glomerulonephritis. Therefore, the patient was started on 500 mg of methylprednisolone intravenously daily for 3 days under the administration of antibiotics on the 9th day. After that, methylprednisolone was sequentially administered at 250 mg daily for 3 days and 125 mg daily for 3 days, followed by oral prednisolone. The administration of prednisolone was started at 60 mg daily on the 20th day and the prednisolone dose was gradually decreased to 20 mg daily on the 96th day.\nWe performed a tracheotomy on the 14th day because we expected that she would need prolonged mechanical ventilation, and she was taken off a ventilator on the 30th day. Chest radiograph and chest CT scan showed a bilateral pulmonary infiltrative shadow that improved on the 64th day and disappeared without lung damage on the 92nd day ().\nA kidney biopsy was performed on the 64th day, because her general condition improved and she was able to move to a prone position.

The linear deposition of IgG was observed in part of the basement membrane by immunofluorescence micrography (see ). Therefore, although an anti-GBM antibody was not detected in the serum, anti-GBM glomerulonephritis was suspected histopathologically.\nShe was transferred to a nearby hospital to continue rehabilitation and maintenance dialysis on the 96th day.

She was persistently tachycardic with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute at rest and higher with minimal exertion, tachypneic (20 breaths per minute), normotensive (mean arterial pressure 80-88 mmHg) and had mild hypoxia with baseline saturations of approximately 90% at rest, decreasing to the mid-80s with mobilisation. She was commenced on supplemental low flow nasal oxygen at a flow rate of three litres per minute which improved her oxygen saturations.\nThe patient was otherwise well with no history of recent viral illness, surgery, trauma, or periods of immobilisation. She had however commenced a COCP consisting of ethinyloestradiol (20 micrograms) and levonorgestrel (100 micrograms) ten weeks prior. The COCP was prescribed by her local doctor for a sharp pelvic pain which started with menstruation and persisted for three weeks, with complete resolution while taking the COCP. The patient reached menarche at twelve years old and experienced dysmenorrhea for the first three days of menstruation with menorrhagia. Apart from her maternal grandmother having endometriosis, there was no significant family history including thrombophilia or thromboembolic events. The patient denied smoking or recreational drug use. She was a competitive sports player who, within a month of commencing the COCP, experienced dyspnea and intermittent chest pain on exertion. Although these symptoms initially resolved with rest, her time to recovery gradually increased.\nIn the ED, a chest X-ray (CXR) revealed mild prominence of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally. Blood tests revealed elevated levels of D-dimer, 5.01 mg/L (normal range 0.02–0.49) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) of 194 Hng/L (normal < 10). Given the history and clinical findings, a computer tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed and confirmed the presence of a saddle PE () with thrombus occluding the right main pulmonary artery, left upper lobe segmental artery, and left interlobar artery. There was also evidence of right heart strain on the CTPA. An urgent echocardiogram revealed systolic dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV) and basal segment dyskinesia, and blood flow through the right pulmonary artery appeared absent. Given the presence of right heart strain, elevated troponin levels, and persistent tachycardia and hypoxia, urgent opinions were sought from multiple pediatric specialists including a respiratory physician, interventional cardiologist, haematologist, and cardiothoracic surgeon.\nThe patient was administered a 10 milligram (mg) bolus of intravenous alteplase, a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) where she then received an infusion of tPA (0.3 mg/kg/h) for 3 hours. The total dose of tPA administered was 80 mg. Following this, the patient was commenced on an unfractionated heparin (UHF) infusion, targeting an anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.7 U/mL. COCP administration was ceased.\nFollowing thrombolysis, the patient's tachycardia resolved, although she remained tachypneic. A repeat echocardiogram within twelve hours showed improvement in the RV systolic dysfunction and definite blood movement through the right pulmonary artery, with ongoing presence of a significant filling defect occupying the vessel. UHF infusion was continued for 48 hours, after which time anticoagulation was changed to 80 mg subcutaneous enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), administered twice a day. Given the significant embolic material seen on the initial CTPA, further discussions ensued regarding the potential benefits and risks of catheter-directed intervention with the aim of decreasing clot burden and potentially reducing the risk of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).\nA repeat CTPA was performed on the fourth day of admission which revealed a substantial decrease in clot burden, no visible saddle embolus, and reduced right heart strain (). The patient no longer required supplemental oxygen and made a steady recovery. Eight days post admission, she was transitioned to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), rivaroxaban, at standard adult dosing (15 mg twice a day for three weeks followed by 20 mg daily), prior to discharge home.\nA thrombophilia screen performed was unremarkable (). She was referred to an adolescent gynaecologist to explore suitable alternatives to taking the COCP. Outpatient spirometry, body plethysmography, and diffusing capacity tests performed a month post discharge were unremarkable. She returned to her baseline function with resolution of the shortness of breath on exertion. A CTPA and echocardiogram performed six months post presentation revealed complete resolution of all pathological changes, and rivaroxaban therapy was stopped ().

The case was diagnosed as a laboratory-confirmed case of influenza A (H7N9) infection with severe pneumonia combined with the complications of acute respiratory failure, septic shock, stress ulcer and acute renal failure. Antiviral treatment (oseltamivir) with combination of antibiotics (Sulperazon), a gastric acid secretion inhibitor (omeprazole), mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement, supportive nutrition therapy and symptomatic treatment were given. On 12 February 2014, the H7N9 viral nucleic acid was negative when detecting the tracheal aspirate specimens by real-time RT-PCR. On 12 March 2014, the infection symptoms and the respiratory function improved, and the circulation situation tended to be stable. After approximately four months of treatment, the patient recovered and was discharged from hospital on 6 June 2014 ().\n\nCalculate Wells' Criteria for DVT by summing the results of the following rules:\n    Active cancer (treatment or palliation within 6 months): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Bedridden recently >3 days or major surgery within 12 weeks: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the other leg (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Collateral (nonvaricose) superficial veins present: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Entire leg swollen: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Localized tenderness along the deep venous system: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Pitting edema, confined to symptomatic leg: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremity: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Previously documented DVT: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Alternative diagnosis to DVT as likely or more likely: No = 0 points, Yes = -2 points",

His ECG revealed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) []. On further enquiry, it was found that the patient is taking amiodarone 600 mg daily for last 3 months. Amiodarone was prescribed to him for one episode of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring cardioversion and he was continuing with the loading dosage of amiodarone by mistake for 3 months. There was no history of any other drug intake. Serum electrolytes were within normal limits. As there was association with no other offending agent other than high dosage of amiodarone, we kept the possibility of amiodarone induced PVT. The patient was treated with intravenous magnesium (2 g) along with intravenous lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV bolus) with out any effect. Intravenous Atropine 1.2 mg was also given to accelerate the sinus rate but failed to suppress the arrhythmia. Two more boluses of lidocaine at five minute intervals along with infusion at a rate of 1 mg/min were administered but the patient continued to have PVT. As the arrhythmia failed to respond to intravenous magnesium, atropine and lidocaine, we thought to try phenytoin to suppress the arrhythmia (a class IB antiarrhythmic drug that suppresses early after depolarization (EAD)) responsible for initiation of PVT secondary to amiodarone overdose).[] Phenytoin was administered in a dosage of 100 mg slowly every 5 minutes. After administration of 300 mg of phenytoin, significant reduction in episodes of PVT was noted and sustained sinus rhythm with corrected QTc of 490 milliseconds was restored within 30 minutes []. The patient was administered intravenous phenytoin 300 mg/day for 2 more days followed by oral phenytoin 300 mg/day. He was discharged after 1 week on oral phenytoin. Predischarge holter monitoring showed normal sinus rhythm with infrequent monomorphic VPCs and no evidence of nonsustained or sustained VT.

            "input": "A 59-year-old man diagnosed with obstructive hydrocephalus was scheduled for an ETV. The patient had a medical history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension that was being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a beta blocker. The body mass index was 33.8, but he had no respiratory symptoms, including sleep apnea. A preoperative chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but electrocardiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. The patient's symptoms were amnesia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence that had persisted for 5 months; preoperatively, he was alert and cooperative and had no problem communicating. The preoperative vital signs were: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 59 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 96%. Since the appearance of the patient suggested a possible difficult intubation, a video laryngoscope was used for tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia with 150 mg propofol 1%, 40 mg lidocaine 2%, and 60 mg rocuronium. The vocal cord was clearly visible on the video laryngoscope and the intubation was accomplished without trauma or other difficulties. Anesthesia was maintained with 5% desflurane and 0.02 µg/kg/min remifentanil, and air with 50% oxygen. The surgery lasted 2 hours and required no additional muscle relaxants. During the surgery, there was sudden and sustained hypotension (mean blood pressure 52–57 mmHg) with bradycardia (heart rate 45–55 beats/min) that did not respond well to ephedrine; these complications began about 10 min after the beginning of the surgery and lasted for 25 min until a dopamine infusion was administered that restored normal blood pressure. Remifentanil infusion was discontinued at the onset of hypotension and bradycardia. After the purge of volatile agents at the end of the surgery, the train of four (TOF) count was 4, and the ratio was 50%, so 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected. The patient recovered muscle power within a few minutes, showing firm hand grip, head elevation, and mouth opening, and was fully obeying verbal commands, but was not opening his eyes. As he was alert and cooperative at that point and no other neurologic deficit was observed, the neurosurgeons thought that the inability to open his eyes was not related to the surgery. We relieved the bandage on the head in order to reduce the chance of unintended pressure or tension on the forehead, and suggested that further neurologic examinations be done after full recovery from anesthesia. Spontaneous respiration was present, showing expired tidal volumes reaching 500 ml each time, but was tachypneic; the patient's respiratory rate ranged from 40 to 50 breaths/min. This condition continued for 5 min, at which time the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU under mask ventilation. The patient showed signs of inspiratory stridor, chest retractions, and hoarse voice after the extubation. The patient's accessory respiratory muscles were not involved in the hyperventilation. There was no crackle or wheezing clear on auscultation besides the inspiratory stridor, but the findings were not clear on account of the hoarse voice and the rapid and dynamic ventilation. An additional 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected in the PACU under the theory that the patient's upper airway was obstructed because of possible residual paralysis but the condition did not change. The patient was fully responsive to verbal commands but was still unable to open his eyes or hold his breath and he complained of feeling like he was choking despite the hyperventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) at that point showed: pH, 7.35; pCO2, 37 mmHg; pO2, 76 mmHg; HCO3, 20.4 mmol/L; and O2 saturation, 94%. The vital signs at that point were: blood pressure, 150/90 mmHg; heart rate, 110 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 44 breaths/min. Since tachypnea (40–50 breaths/min) persisted for 20 min in the PACU and oxygen saturation started to drop under 95%, 200 mg thiopental sodium and 100 mg succinylcholine were injected and endotracheal intubation was performed. Endotracheal suction was done immediately after intubation and there was no sputum or discharge. Auscultation right after the re-intubation sounded smooth, without crackle or wheezing, and the oxygen saturation rapidly corrected to 100%. Tachypnea persisted even under sedation after the succinylcholine wore off, so a central cause was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive pneumocephalus with pneumoventricle and hydrocephalus (). A chest X-ray taken after the brain CT showed no pathologic findings such as pulmonary edema, congestion, or pneumothorax. On the neurosurgeon's recommendation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was kept there for three days under mechanical ventilation with sedation with midazolam, cisatracurium, and rocuronium until the pneumocephalus and tachypnea spontaneously resolved. Follow-up chest radiographs were taken over the next 3 weeks and showed nothing abnormal. According to a pulmonology consultation, the tachypnea was not likely to have originated from pulmonary problems. ABGA results stayed within normal limits under fully controlled mechanical ventilation but showed hypoxemia when the patient gained spontaneous respiration during the sedative period before the resolution of the pneumocephalus. Since the follow-up chest X-rays showed no abnormal findings, pulmonary embolism evaluation including embolism CT and laboratory examinations, which also showed nothing abnormal, were done on the recommendation of a pulmonologist. When a follow-up brain CT showed resolution of the pneumocephalus on the 3rd day after the surgery, sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents were discontinued and the mechanical ventilation mode was switched to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The respiratory rate at that point ranged from 15 to 20 breaths/min and ABGA results remained normal when the patient gained consciousness and self-respiration, so the endotracheal tube was extubated. The patient is now (30 days post-operation) in the general ward; he is mentally alert and has stable vital signs but still is unable to open his eyes because of bilateral ptosis and is receiving conservative treatment.\n\nWhat is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?\n\nA 59-year-old man diagnosed with obstructive hydrocephalus was scheduled for an ETV.

She is from an average Sri Lankan middle class family with no significant family history of ovarian disease and with an average socioeconomic background. She was vaccinated in concordance with the extended immunization schedule of Sri Lanka and there were no significant environmental hazards. She was seen by her general practitioner 3 days prior with postprandial vomiting with no associated diarrhea, constipation, or urinary symptoms. She was otherwise well and was not in pain. She was diagnosed as having acute gastroenteritis. On the third day of the illness, as the symptoms persisted, she was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation.\nOn examination, she was not in pain but noted to be bent forward while walking. She was comfortable in the seated position and was playful. An examination of her vital signs revealed that they were normal for her age with good hydration and her axillary temperature was 36.2 °C. A cardiovascular system examination revealed a pulse rate of 97 beats/minute, and blood pressure of 96/70 mmHg. Her respiratory rate was 24 breaths/minute and her oxygen saturation 100% on room air without any features suggestive of respiratory distress. The rest of the detailed examination of her cardiovascular and respiratory systems did not reveal any abnormalities. She was rational and conscious with no features suggestive of past or acute neurological deficits. On examination of her abdomen, there was guarding, which was mainly confined to the lower abdomen, equally on both sides. There were no classic clinical features such as severe tenderness on the right inguinal fossa and rebound tenderness to suggest appendicitis. There were no hepatosplenomegaly or ballotable kidneys.\nOur patient’s white blood cell count was elevated to 14,700/mm3 with 53% lymphocytes and 45% leukocytes.

A magnetic resonance imaging scan of her abdomen revealed an enlarged right ovary with hemorrhages at various stages with multiple enlarged follicles within it, which was suggestive of OT (Fig. a–d). It did not show any enhancement with intravenous gadolinium.\nExploratory laparoscopy revealed a twisted gangrenous right ovary (Fig. ) following which an oophorectomy was performed as no viable ovarian tissue was noticed.

She reported a weight loss of 15 pounds in the past year. She had been a smoker but had quit five years prior to the presentation. Prior to this hospital visit, she had consulted an outpatient clinic with complaints of fever, chills, and cough. She had received a flu vaccine a month prior. She had been thought to have a viral respiratory infection as an outpatient. Ibuprofen, and later azithromycin, had been prescribed, which had not alleviated her initial symptoms before the current presentation.\nOn physical exam, she had a temperature of 39.3 °C in the emergency department. She was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure was 149/74 mmHg. She had bilateral conjunctival injection, but her eyelids were grossly unremarkable. There was left axillary lymphadenopathy. A physical breast exam was normal with no palpable masses. There was no other palpable adenopathy, skin rashes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, clubbing, or edema. The respiratory and cardiovascular exams were otherwise unremarkable. Her ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per minute but was otherwise unremarkable.\nRelevant laboratory workup included a leukocytosis of 16.7 Thou/uL (normal range: 3.8-10.2) with a neutrophilic predominance of 82.9%. She had chronic anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.9 g/dl (11.9-15.1) and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 fL (78.2-98.4). Her ferritin was more than 7,500 ng/ml (11-307), with a total iron-binding capacity of 204 (250-450), and a low iron level of 37 ug/dl (50-212). Her angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 97 U/l (8-52). Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 19.05 mg/dl (0.02-1.00), D-dimer was 13.46 ugFEU/ml (<0.50), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 54 U/L (13-39), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 66 U/L (7-52); she had calcium of 9.0 mg/dl (8.6-10.2), albumin of 3.0 g/dl (3.5-5.0), corrected calcium of 9.8 mg/dl, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level of 22.4 ng/ml (30-100), creatinine of 1.11 mg/dl (0.49-1.01), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 344 U/L (140-271).\nThe patient had not undergone a prior mammogram. A CT angiography (CTA) was performed, which ruled out any pulmonary embolus. There was no evidence of a pulmonary embolus, or pulmonary nodules, or infiltrates. However, the CTA revealed right hilar lymphadenopathy of 1.3 cm in size and subcarinal lymphadenopathy of 1.1 cm (Figures , ).\nA CT of the abdomen revealed a cystic mass of the left retroperitoneum measuring 14 x 11 x 6 cm. The official radiology report suggested that it was of a benign etiology, which could include cystic lymphangioma, mesenteric cyst, or duplication cyst. A cystic neoplasm was considered unlikely in the radiology report. The patient was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin as well as intravenous fluids to treat a possible unknown infective source while awaiting cultures and further investigation. It was initially thought that a respiratory or abdominal source was the possible infective foci, which guided the selection of antibiotics.\nThe infectious disease team suspected an intrabdominal or lung infective etiology. An initial differential by the infectious diseases specialists, aside from infection, also included lymphoma and autoimmune processes such as sarcoidosis. The pulmonology team later advised that there was no evidence of pneumonia or tracheobronchitis. The hematology team emphasized the need to rule out lymphoma. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures were all negative. Antibiotics were initially tapered to ceftriaxone and metronidazole and then completely discontinued on day six. Drainage of the abdominal cyst revealed 250 mL of pale straw-colored serous fluid. Fluid chemistries were negative for an infectious or malignant etiology.\nThe patient underwent extensive investigation. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, serum creatine kinase levels, serum HIV tests, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, an acute hepatitis panel, three acid-fast sputum stains, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test, anti-SS-A antibody levels, anti-SS-B antibody levels, and urinalysis were all normal. She did, however, test positive for an antinuclear antibody (ANA) speckled+ pattern. The ANA titer was 1:320. The double-stranded DNA antibody levels were within the normal range at 49 Iu/ml (<200 Iu/ml). A bone marrow biopsy of the iliac crest showed no evidence of malignancy or acid-fast bacilli.\nSurgery was consulted for an excisional lymph node biopsy of the left axillary lymph node. The sample was a solid tan nodular-appearing tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Biopsy revealed numerous non-caseating epithelioid granulomas present in the lymphoid tissue. Stains were negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungus. The biopsy results were consistent with sarcoidosis. Flow cytometry later showed no evidence of B or T cell lymphoma.\nA tentative diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. The granulomatous disease is seen only in sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or fungal infections. The non-caseating granulomatous disease in the lymph nodes pointed most closely to sarcoidosis. The pulmonologist considered this to be a case of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis because only hilar nodes were involved without any lung parenchymal involvement. It was thought conceivable that the ANA elevation may have been related to sarcoidosis, although we agreed to continue to monitor the patient for other collagen vascular diseases.\nDuring the hospitalization, the patient had daily high-grade fevers. The fevers were intermittent, daily, variable, and went from 38.4 to a high of 39.4 °C. The patient was also seen by ophthalmology, and she was diagnosed with blepharitis. No uveitis or episcleritis was noted. She was treated with eye drops containing steroids, antimicrobials, and artificial tears. She was started on prednisone 40 mg PO daily with outpatient follow-up. Her fever and ocular symptoms resolved. She was seen in an outpatient clinic prior to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and then moved to a different location.\n\nWhat is the patient’s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?\n\nOur patient was a 48-year-old female with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who presented to the hospital with a two-week history of dry cough, fever, red conjunctiva, chills, malaise, myalgias, and generalized weakness. She reported a weight loss of 15 pounds in the past year. She had been a smoker but had quit five years prior to the presentation. Prior to this hospital visit, she had consulted an outpatient clinic with complaints of fever, chills, and cough. She had received a flu vaccine a month prior. She had been thought to have a viral respiratory infection as an outpatient. Ibuprofen, and later azithromycin, had been prescribed, which had not alleviated her initial symptoms before the current presentation.\nOn physical exam, she had a temperature of 39.3 °C in the emergency department. She was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure was 149/74 mmHg. She had bilateral conjunctival injection, but her eyelids were grossly unremarkable. There was left axillary lymphadenopathy. A physical breast exam was normal with no palpable masses. There was no other palpable adenopathy, skin rashes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, clubbing, or edema. The respiratory and cardiovascular exams were otherwise unremarkable. Her ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per minute but was otherwise unremarkable.\nRelevant laboratory workup included a leukocytosis of 16.7 Thou/uL (normal range: 3.8-10.2) with a neutrophilic predominance of 82.9%. She had chronic anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.9 g/dl (11.9-15.1) and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 fL (78.2-98.4). Her ferritin was more than 7,500 ng/ml (11-307), with a total iron-binding capacity of 204 (250-450), and a low iron level of 37 ug/dl (50-212). Her angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 97 U/l (8-52). Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 19.05 mg/dl (0.02-1.00), D-dimer was 13.46 ugFEU/ml (<0.50), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 54 U/L (13-39), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 66 U/L (7-52); she had calcium of 9.0 mg/dl (8.6-10.2), albumin of 3.0 g/dl (3.5-5.0), corrected calcium of 9.8 mg/dl, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level of 22.4 ng/ml (30-100), creatinine of 1.11 mg/dl (0.49-1.01), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 344 U/L (140-271).\nThe patient had not undergone a prior mammogram. A CT angiography (CTA) was performed, which ruled out any pulmonary embolus. There was no evidence of a pulmonary embolus, or pulmonary nodules, or infiltrates. However, the CTA revealed right hilar lymphadenopathy of 1.3 cm in size and subcarinal lymphadenopathy of 1.1 cm (Figures , ).\nA CT of the abdomen revealed a cystic mass of the left retroperitoneum measuring 14 x 11 x 6 cm. The official radiology report suggested that it was of a benign etiology, which could include cystic lymphangioma, mesenteric cyst, or duplication cyst. A cystic neoplasm was considered unlikely in the radiology report. The patient was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin as well as intravenous fluids to treat a possible unknown infective source while awaiting cultures and further investigation.

She had been treated for presumed bronchitis with wide-spectrum antibiotics without response and her complaints had gradually worsened. Her past medical history was significant for bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, which was incidentally diagnosed on a routine chest radiograph 8 years previously, a finding that was confirmed, together with right paratracheal node enlargement, by a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. She had then undergone a non-diagnostic bronchoscopy and was advised to repeat the chest CT scan after 6 months, advice she ignored. She had never smoked and she had not taken any medication in the past. She had no environmental or occupational history of beryllium or other metal exposure. She had never traveled outside Greece. She had never had a tuberculin test.\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared to be in good condition, mildly dyspneic with 22 breaths per minute, a temperature of 39.4°C, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg and a heart rate of 100 beats per minute. Apart from mild bilateral inspiratory fine crackles in the lower lung fields, no other physical abnormalities were observed. There was no skin involvement.

When the patient arrived at our hospital, he had anxiety and had a respiratory rate of 30/min, pulse rate of 120/min, and supine blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. Additionally, the patient’s lungs were clear and his heart sound and lower limb were normal. Chest X-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly, dilated right descending pulmonary artery, and oligemia in the right lung ().\nOn echocardiography, the left ventricle was normal; however, the right heart was dilated and trabeculated and there was also right ventricular dysfunction. The pulmonary artery pressure was elevated to 45 mmHg. The patient denied any history of deep vein thrombosis and mentioned only a six-hour car travel more than three weeks earlier. His family history for venous thromboembolism was weakly positive and one of his nephews had a history of pulmonary thromboembolism.\nAt this point, lung CT angiography was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism as the main cause of acute right ventricular enlargement. The CT angiography demonstrated bilateral pulmonary artery thrombosis from the first division of the right and left pulmonary arteries to the distal ones ( & ).\nWith a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, the patient underwent thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-TPA) 100mg over a 90-minute period, which brought about immediate improvement in the patient’s condition. The following day, his symptoms improved dramatically, his respiratory rate decreased, his O2 saturation rose from 85% to 98%, and his blood pressure remained stable in different positions.\nCT angiography showed improved right ventricular function and decreased right ventricular size and pulmonary arteries (&).\n\nWhat is the patient's HEART score?\n\nA 52-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of two episodes of syncope within a fortnight. He had suffered from pleuritic chest pain and dry coughs for the previous two weeks, and antibiotics prescribed for pneumonia by an internist failed to prevent the exacerbation of the symptoms. The internist subsequently referred the patient to a cardiologist, who subjected him to an exercise stress test (to rule out coronary artery disease), during which he developed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.

Her babies were healthy and weighed between 2,500 to 2,925 g at birth. In May 2017, she underwent a laser cone biopsy for CIN 3 with clear margins achieved. Excisional biopsy was the treatment of choice as it was a type two transformational zone. A laser cone was performed instead of a loop electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP) in view of a large transformational zone. Subsequent follow up cervical smear and examination were normal.

            "input": "An 80-year-old italian woman of Caucasian origin presented to the emergency room at the Catholic University of Rome with severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Her symptoms, which had developed over the last four months, consisted of unrelenting lower abdominal pain that began 30 minutes after eating and lasted for about three hours. It was unrelieved by bowel movements or changes in position. For this reason, the patient reduced her food intake, and her weight decreased by 5 kg. The day before admission, bloody diarrhea developed.\nThe patient had a history of arterial hypertension, hiatal hernia, bilateral hearing loss due to chronic otomastoiditis, and polyarthritis (cervical, dorsal, and lumbosacral spondylosis; bilateral osteoarthritis of the hip). She had undergone open surgical cholecystectomy for gallstones in 1959. In 1998, she was hospitalized for rectal bleeding caused by acute diverticulitis. In 2004, she was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the papilla of Vater and had a cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy. The pathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated intestinal-type adenocarcinoma measuring 1.5 cm in diameter that had invaded the muscle layers of the duodenal wall. The margins were tumor-free, and two lymph nodes were negative for malignancy. During that hospitalization, she developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that was converted to a normal sinus rhythm with amiodarone. Her medications included zofenopril (7.5 mg/day), manidipine (10 mg/day), esomeprazole 20 mg/day, celecoxib (400-600 mg/day), and acetaminophen plus codeine (500 mg plus 30 mg/day). She had no known drug allergies.\nDuring admission, she was alert and oriented with normal vital signs (blood pressure, 150/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 80 beats per minute; temperature, 36.8°C). The lower abdomen was tender, but there were no signs of peritonitis. Although the bowel sounds were decreased, passage of flatus and feces was normal. There was no palpable organomegaly. The patient's lungs were clear on auscultation and a systolic ejection murmur (2/6) was heard over her aortic area. Admission laboratory tests revealed: hemoglobin 12.1 g/dl; white-cell count 15,290/mm3 (neutrophils 86%); platelet count 317,000/mm3; total protein 5.6 g/dl; albumin 3.2 g/dl. Serum electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, and amylase levels were within normal limits, as were the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time. Plain films of the abdomen revealed no free intraperitoneal air or air-fluid levels, and the chest x-ray excluded the presence of pneumonia or nodules. Immediately after admission she was placed on an NPO (nil per os) regimen with total parenteral nutrition, and within eight hours her symptoms completely disappeared.\nAbdominal CT (Figure ) revealed a hypodense mass measuring 4 × 4 cm in the space between the vena cava and the aorta, at the level of the origin of the celiac trunk. The mass extended caudally for about 4 cm, enveloping the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, the left renal vein at its confluence into the inferior vena cava, and the origin of the right renal artery, and anteriorly to the confluence of the splenic and mesenteric veins. Enlarged lymph nodes (1 cm) were observed at the hepatic hilum and in the intercavoaortic and left para-aortic spaces. Thickened bowel loops were also seen. This picture was consistent with local recurrence of the neoplastic disease.\nA week later, oral feedings were resumed and the patient once again experienced diffuse abdominal pain and diarrhea. The pain responded poorly to conventional analgesics (scopolamine 20 mg IV, acetaminophen 500 mg PO, tramadol 37.5 mg PO t.i.d., fentanyl 25 μg transdermally), but it disappeared promptly when oral feedings were withdrawn.\nA duplex ultrasound examination was performed to assess the mesenteric circulation (Figure and Figure ). To the extent that it could be explored, the artery showed no evident stenoses on B-mode or color- and power-Doppler evaluation. The superior mesenteric artery was characterized by a high peak systolic velocity (283 cm/sec) that was consistent with vascular stenosis. Blood flow in the celiac artery was turbulent, and the peak systolic velocity was also high (118 cm/sec). The patient was started on subcutaneous enoxaparin (4000 U/day) and transdermal nitroglycerin (10 mg/day, from 08.00 to 20.00). Since oral feedings could not be resumed, a central venous catheter was inserted for prolonged parenteral nutrition.\nIn view of the tumor histotype and the age and general condition of the patient, there was no indication for systemic chemotherapy and the patient was transferred to a hospice. She remained pain-free without any form of analgesics and had a relatively good quality of life until her death three months later.\n\nWhat is the patient’s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?\n\nAn 80-year-old italian woman of Caucasian origin presented to the emergency room at the Catholic University of Rome with severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.

Prior to admission, she required help with high-order activities of daily living, such as heavy housework; she was relatively independent with activities of daily living, receiving some support from her family for the same, but she rarely left her house. This put her in the category of “mildly frail” on the Clinical Frailty Scale 5.[] Her past medical history included hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diet-controlled diabetes mellitus-type 2. Her vital signs following initial assessment were: Heart rate 94/min, blood pressure 104/71 mmHg, respiratory rate 19/min, temperature 36.2° C and oxygen saturation 92% on 6 L O2 delivered through nasal cannula. Her laboratory results revealed: White cell count 3.4 × 10 9/L (normal range: 4.0–11.0 × 109/L), neutrophils 2.43 × 10 9/L (2.0–7.7), lymphocyte 0.82 × 10 9/L (0.8–3.4), C-reactive protein (CRP) 100 mg/L (0–8), urea 4.7 mmol/L (3.0–7.6), and creatinine of 62 umol/L (65–114). Chest X-ray (CXR) showed bilateral infiltrates that were most apparent in the left middle and right lower zones [].\nShe was initially managed as suspected COVID-19 pneumonia with an exacerbation of COPD. On day-3 of admission she deteriorated significantly; she became cyanosed and tachypnoeic at 30 breaths per minute and 15 L/min oxygen via a mask with a reservoir bag was required to achieve oxygen saturation of 90%. Molecular testing confirmed the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on nasopharyngeal swab, confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Arterial blood gas analysis on 15 L/min oxygen via a mask with a reservoir bag showed: pH 7.49, pC02–4.9 kPa, and pO2–4.2 kPa, in keeping with severe lung injury. She was commenced on CPAP of 10 cm H20 with 60% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Following initiation of CPAP, she improved symptomatically with reduction in respiratory rate and achieved saturations at 92% on 60% FiO2. The CPAP management strategy was to titrate pressures up to a maximum of 15 cm H20 with an aim to keep FiO2 requirements to 60% or less, as far as possible, with target saturation of 88%–92%.[] A do-not-attempt resuscitation order was placed and agreed with the family, which included the decision that the patient would not be suitable for invasive ventilation through an endotracheal tube; this was based on the patient's premorbid functional status and perceived poor prognosis with these interventions.\nOn day 4 of the admission, her oxygen requirements increased to an Fio2 of 90%, and she was CPAP dependent on 15 cm H2O, rapidly desaturating when it was removed. A nasogastric (NG) tube was inserted to maintain both nutrition and hydration. A repeat CXR showed worsening consolidation in both lungs consistent with worsening COVID-19 pneumonia []. Rising inflammatory markers prompted the initiation of empirical antibiotics (Moxifloxacin) to cover possible secondary bacterial infection []. The patient's condition initially stabilized; by day 10, she was weaned to overnight CPAP only, maintaining adequate oxygen saturation on 2 L/min of oxygen delivered through nasal cannula and the feeding NG-tube was removed.\nDespite initial improvement, she experienced a second phase of clinical deterioration on day 12 (20 days from onset of symptoms) with worsening respiratory parameters (respiratory rate 37 and oxygen saturations falling to 86% on 5 L/min oxygen through nasal cannulae). CPAP was recommenced with titration of pressure and FiO2 as earlier described. A feeding NG-tube was reinserted. A repeat CXR [] showed worsening infiltrates bilaterally, suggestive of ARDS and there was a concomitant rise in CRP levels []. Along with raised CRP levels, interleukin-6 levels were raised at 50.1 pg/mL (0–7), ferritin levels were 302 ug/L and D-dimer 4236 ng/mL. Although the clinical picture was in keeping with worsening COVID-19, empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam was restarted to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. However, multiple sputum and blood cultures did not demonstrate growth of pathogens. The patient slowly improved and was again weaned from CPAP with this being discontinued on day 27 of admission, completing 24 days of CPAP treatment in total. Clinical improvement was reflected in the decline of CRP levels to 11 mg/L from a high of 314 mg/L. Interleukin-6 levels also decreased to 14.2 pg/ml. She was discharged after 30 days of treatment for COVID-19 at which time she no longer required supplementary oxygen and was close to her normal premorbid state.

A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates () and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected and tested positive for COVID-19 using molecular testing.\nThe patient was moved to the ICU with the diagnosis of Coronavirus-19 pneumonia. Clinical history was updated to include a previous diagnosis of diabetes and hypertension. Corticosteroid therapy with dexamethasone (12 mg/day) and C-PAP ventilation were immediately required. In the following days, laboratory tests showed significant increases of white blood cells (up to 30210/mm3) and lactate (up to 864 U/L), and low albumin (down to 2.27 g/dL). There was also a high increase of C-reactive protein up to 101.87 mg/L. On day 4, seric levels of the GM (Platelia Aspergillus; Biorad) and 1,3-β-D-glucan (Fungitell; Associates of Cape Cod Inc., Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA) were prescribed because of the patient's risk factors, which tested negative. On day 10 ventilator support with oro-tracheal intubation was implemented, due to a rapid decline of the patient's consciousness and respiratory quality. Because of a fever episode, antibiotic treatment with meropenem (3g/day) was started and a peripheral blood sample was taken for a microbiological culture, which tested negative. On the same day some surveillance exams were performed: cultures from rectal, nasal and pharyngeal swabs reported a normal microbiota, while a culture from a urinary sample revealed 100000 ufc/ml of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because of this positive result the urinary catheter was removed and a therapeutic lavage with antibiotics was carried out, with complete resolution. On day 16 a new chest X-ray was performed that showed a pulmonary worsening ().\nAt the same time, new seric dosages were required: β-glucan serum level was 84 pg/mL while galactomannan had a T index of 4.9, suggestive of probable fungal angioinvasion. A bronchoaspirate sample was collected for bacteriological and mycological examinations, because of the persistence of high inflammation indices. For the mycological examination conventional methods by microscopic and fungal culture in Sabouraud's dextrose agar medium supplemented with chloramphenicol and gentamycin were performed. Molecular methods were also used and real-time PCR assay for the detection of Aspergillus was carried out. The AsperGenius® multiplex PCR (PathoNostics, The Netherlands) was used for the detection of the most clinically relevant Aspergillus species. DNA was extracted by using the GenoXtract instrument (Hain Lifescience, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed adding 5 μl of DNA extract to the PCR mix and a Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) was used for amplification and melting curve analysis. The direct microscopic examination with 15% potassium hydroxide (KOH) showed several hyaline septate hyphae and Aspergillus sp. was detected by PCR. After 72 h of incubation at 32 °C, the growth of numerous colonies was observed ().\nIdentification of the isolate was performed by standard phenotypic methods, based on macroscopic and microscopic morphological studies. The pathogen was identified as Aspergillus section Nigri. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry on a Microflex LT (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) platform after ethanol-formic acid extraction, identified the isolate as Aspergillus niger (score: 2.155). The same sample reported negative results from bacteriological examinations. Surveillance cultures from oropharyngeal, rectal and nasal swabs also revealed the presence of Aspergillus niger.

Since no improvements were confirmed by the imaging and laboratory findings, antimicrobial treatment was changed to tazobactam/piperacillin on day 3 post admission, and was subsequently changed to meropenem (MEPM) on day 25 post admission. Treatment with voriconazole (VRCZ) was added on day 17 post admission because his β-D-glucan level reached to 123 pg/ml (normal range, < 20 pg/ml). However, it was discontinued 8 days later. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage performed to assess the mass did not detect malignancy or significant levels of bacteria, including mycobacteria and fungi. On day 27, the patient was referred to our tertiary center for further examination and treatment by specialists in respirology and infection and potential thoracic surgery. Since the definitive diagnosis could not be made, the patient was transferred to our hospital for further examination and treatment on day 27.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: a body temperature of 36.6 °C, blood pressure of 120/66 mmHg, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The arterial oxygen saturation measured via pulse oximetry was 98% in the examination room. A physical examination including respiratory sound revealed no significant finding. Clinical laboratory tests showed that the patient had elevated C-reactive protein levels of 15.56 mg/dl (normal range, < 0.40 mg/dl) and his Aspergillus antigen test was positive (cut-off index of 3.5). Human immunodeficiency virus antibody and interferon-gamma releasing assay were negative. In addition, the β-D-glucan level decreased to a normal range (14.7 pg/ml). Chest X-ray and contrast-enhanced CT were performed on admission. Chest X-ray showed an infiltrative shadow in the left lower lung field (Fig. ), and CT showed a massive lesion in the left lower lobe of the lung, emphysematous changes, ectatic bronchi, and a nodular lesion that was thought to contain a mucoid impaction within its lingular segment. The bronchus was disrupted proximal to the mass lesion of the left lower lobe (Fig. a–c). Consequently, bronchial atresia in the inferior and anterior basal segments of the left lung was suspected based on imaging findings. Since the presence of a malignant lesion could not be excluded, bronchoscopy was performed on day 2 after transfer to our hospital. An endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration was performed on the small mass lesion near the left second carina (Fig. d). The disrupted bronchus could not be confirmed via bronchoscopy because the disrupted site was located too peripherally. Histopathological analyses revealed no malignant findings, but presence of a filamentous fungus was indicated in Grocott staining (Fig. ). Although cultures did not detect any microorganisms, based on these findings, a lung abscess due to Aspergillus spp. was suspected. Therefore, VRCZ was reintroduced on day 9 after transfer. To perform treatment and confirm the suspected diagnosis of a lung abscess due to an Aspergillus infection, the patient underwent surgical resection of the lingular and basal segments of the left lung on day 22 after transfer. The abscess formation was macroscopically confirmed (Fig. ), and histopathological examination revealed emphysematous changes and ectatic bronchi within the lingular and left basal segments (Fig. a, b). These findings were compatible with bronchial atresia [], and no malignant lesions were confirmed. Although histopathological analyses did not reveal filamentous fungus, a tissue culture resulted in A. fumigatus growth. MEPM and intravenous VRCZ were continued for a total of 4 weeks and 3 weeks, respectively, and the patient was discharged on day 32 after transfer with continuing oral treatment with VRCZ. VRCZ was discontinued 5 months after the initiation of treatment because of poor medication compliance and the side effect of alopecia, and subsequent recurrence of the infection has not been confirmed.\n\nWhat is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?\n\nA 30-year-old male with no medical history was admitted to the nearby hospital with a worsening cough and low-grade fever that had persisted for a month.

A total of 25 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine and 15 mL of 1.5% mepivacaine were injected around the trunks of the brachial plexus. An additional 7 mL of 1.5% mepivacaine was used for the T2 nerve block.\nThe patient was then brought into the operative suite, where standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors and a nasal cannula were attached. Then, 3 mg of midazolam was administered for anxiolysis, anterograde amnesia, and prophylaxis against potential emergence delirium. The patient was positioned in the beach chair position (BCP), and a propofol infusion at 70 mcg/kg per minute was started with a low background dose of ketamine at 0.2 mg/kg per hour.

He had no known allergies. On physical examination, he was 188 cm and 100 kg (body mass index: 28.3) with a Mallampati score of 2, his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, and he had a regular rate and rhythm on a benign cardiac examination. The patient expressed his desire to be “asleep” throughout the duration of the surgery.\nIntravenous (IV) access was obtained and 2 mg of midazolam with 50 mcg of fentanyl was administered. We performed a left interscalene and T2 nerve block and maintained anesthesia with a ketamine–propofol infusion. A total of 25 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine and 15 mL of 1.5% mepivacaine were injected around the trunks of the brachial plexus. An additional 7 mL of 1.5% mepivacaine was used for the T2 nerve block.\nThe patient was then brought into the operative suite, where standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors and a nasal cannula were attached. Then, 3 mg of midazolam was administered for anxiolysis, anterograde amnesia, and prophylaxis against potential emergence delirium. The patient was positioned in the beach chair position (BCP), and a propofol infusion at 70 mcg/kg per minute was started with a low background dose of ketamine at 0.2 mg/kg per hour. During the case, the patient was administered an additional 30 mg of IV ketamine in 10 mg aliquots and an initial 30 mg dose of ketorolac toward the end of the procedure for multimodal pain control.

Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.\nApproximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.\nThree months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology.

On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.\nIn addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative.

She reports feeling well until two weeks ago, when she became unusually tired and developed a sore throat. Her mother took her temperature at home and reports that it was as high as 101.8°F (38.8°C). The patient reports that her sore throat has started to improve in the last few days, but her mother continues to be concerned that her daughter is missing school. The patient endorses heavy periods, soaking two menstrual pads per day and lasting for seven days. Her last menstrual period began two days ago. She denies sick contacts but has two younger siblings, and her father was recently diagnosed with multiple myeloma.

            "input": "History of presentation and past medical history\nA 39-year-old Kenyan male with no past medical history presented with midsternal chest pain. He had been residing within the USA for the last year and working as a long-distance truck driver. The patient described the pain as a heaviness which sometimes felt sharp and lasted several hours long. He had been experiencing this pain for two days and the pain usually started in the morning and worsened with exertion. On the day of presentation, he rated the pain 9 out of 10 on the severity scale and denied any symptoms of shortness of breath or pleuritic type chest discomfort associated with respiration. He was administered aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin; the nitroglycerin did not relieve his chest pain and his presentation was worrisome for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was completely afebrile and vital signs were stable. Physical examination only revealed some elicited pain with range of motion of his left arm. He denied any alcohol use, tobacco use, or illicit drug use and denied any family history of cardiac disease.\nInvestigations\nHis ECG showed 1 to 2 mm ST elevations in lead I and aVL, ST depression in aVR, mild J-point elevation, and T-wave inversion in leads II, III and aVF (Figure ). His ECG was not entirely convincing of STEMI and his troponins were found to be elevated at 5.97 ng/mL and eventually peaked to 6.24 ng/mL. He was taken urgently for cardiac catheterization and it revealed completely normal coronaries so no intervention was performed (Figures -). There was no evidence of myocardial bridging either.\nGiven his profession of being a long-distance truck driver and traveling, he was tested via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) and was found to be positive. Subsequently, a CT scan was done to rule out pulmonary embolism as the cause of his chest pain since SARS-CoV-2 virus induces a hypercoagulable and thrombotic state in individuals []. CT scan was negative for any pulmonary embolism and revealed clear lungs without any typical respiratory characteristics of COVID-19. This was followed up with a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and it revealed no wall motion abnormalities and a completely normal ejection fraction at 55%-60% and no evidence of pericarditis or pericardial effusion.\nThe patient's blood work was consistent with biomarkers typically identified with COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2): his d-dimer was elevated at 0.96 mcg/mL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) elevated at 44 mm/hr, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevated at 926 units/L, procalcitonin was negative at 0.04 ng/mL, C-reactive protein (CRP) elevated at 3.3 mg/dL, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevated at 366 units/L, amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) elevated at 379 pg/mL, and mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevated at 89 units/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevated at 152 units/L []. COVID-19 is commonly associated with elevated ferritin levels since ferritin is an acute phase reactant but interestingly, in our patient, the ferritin was within normal limits at 243 ng/mL [].\nDifferential diagnosis\nInitially, STEMI was at the top of the differential given that he had an equivocal ECG and worsening chest pain. With cardiac catheterization revealing normal coronary arteries and no lesion inducing stenosis, myocarditis became the top differential given that he had evidence of myocardial injury with the troponin leak. Cardiac catheterization also ruled out any concern for myocardial bridging as the source of his chest pain.\nManagement and follow-up\nThe patient was managed conservatively during his hospitalization. Interestingly, after his cardiac catheterization, his chest pain resolved and the pain was well-controlled with acetaminophen alone. He was not on any medications prior to admission and was discharged in a stable condition with acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were avoided for the concern of exacerbating myocardial inflammation due to COVID-19.

She described her neck pain as throbbing, moderate to severe in intensity, worse with right-sided neck movement, and improved with lying on the left side of the neck. She also reported an episode of bilious vomiting prior to the hospital admission. She denied fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, photophobia, blurring of vision, weakness or sensory loss, joint pain, photosensitivity, oral ulcer, family history of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or vasculitis. Physical examination was benign, except for mild tenderness to the left side of the neck with palpation, but no redness, swelling, lymphadenopathy, bruit, or decreased was pulsation noted.\nHer lab work revealed normal complete blood count with white blood cell count of 7 × 103/µL, hemoglobin/hematocrit of 14.1/41.8 g/dL, platelet count of 241; normal basic metabolic panel; and elevated sedimentation rate (ESR) to 24 (ref: <20 mm/hr) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to 11.8 (ref: <8 mg/L). Neurology was consulted and recommended CT angiogram (CTA) of head and neck that revealed no evidence of dissection or stenosis within bilateral carotids and no stenosis, aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation in the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation. MRI neck soft tissue revealed hyperintensity and postcontrast enhancement and thickening of walls of the distal left common carotid at the left carotid bifurcation and proximal left internal carotid artery as well as mild thickening and enhancement of the wall of the right common carotid artery near the bifurcation, suggestive of vasculitis as shown in Figure . She was also evaluated by rheumatology. Rheumatological work-up was negative including antinuclear antibody (ANA), cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), centromere antibody, double-stranded DNA, histone, topoisomerase 1 (SCL-70), histidyl tRNA synthetase (JO-1), ribonucleoprotein (RNP), smith, Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen A (SSA), and Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen B (SSB) autoantibodies. Her immunoglobin levels (IgA, IgM, and IgG) and complement (C3, C4, and total) levels were also normal. Her infectious work-up including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immune deficiency virus, Epstein-Barr virus, COVID-19, syphilis serology, blood culture, and respiratory viral panel were also negative. She was started on a high dose of steroids along with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis as per rheumatology recommendations. She also had a CT scan of the thorax and abdomen with contrast to assess for vasculitis of other blood vessels, which were negative.\nHer neck pain and headache improved slightly during the hospital stay and she was discharged home with a referral to an outpatient rheumatology clinic. There, the patient was diagnosed with TAK with carotidynia and secondary hypertension. The patient’s symptoms were well-controlled with 60 mg of prednisone daily. The patient subsequently transferred care to a local rheumatologist office and was placed on a prednisone taper.

            "input": "A 63-year-old male was admitted after sustaining an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) just 10 days ago. Cardiovascular risk factors included diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking. Despite aggressive medical therapy, frequent rest angina and short of breath recurred at the time of admission to our hospital. Physical examination revealed fine wet rales in the bottom part of the lung. Laboratory values showed troponin I (TnI) of 1.17 ng/mL (normal range 0 - 0.05 ng/mL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 4.6 mmol/L, creatinine of 93 μmol/L, fasting plasma glucose of 9.64 mmol/L, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 6.7%, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 1,958.5 pg/mL (normal range 0 - 125 pg/mL). Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and anterior precordial leads ST-segment elevation and T waves inversion (). An echocardiogram revealed an enlarged left ventricular cavity (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension 61 mm, left ventricular end-systolic dimension 42 mm) and a nearly normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 53% with segmental wall-motion abnormalities: hypokinesis in anterior wall and the septum. The diagnosis of subacute anterior STEMI was made based on the history and clinical examination. Cardiac catheterization revealed a subtotal occlusion in the proximal and middle part of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), mild stenosis in the left main coronary artery (LM) () and diffuse lesion in the proximal and 85% stenosis in the distal part of right coronary artery (RCA) (). According to the patient’s SYNTAX score of 22, we decided to perform PCI for these lesions.\nAfter predilation with 1.5 × 15 mm and 2.0 × 20 mm Ryujin balloons (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), two sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) were implanted successfully: Firebird (MicroPort Medical, Shanghai, China) 2.75 × 23 mm in middle LAD and Excel (JW Medical, Shandong, China) 3.0 × 24 mm in the proximal LAD (2 to 3-mm overlap at the ends). Post-dilation was performed with a non-compliance 3.0 × 24 mm Maverick Quantum balloon (Boston Scientific, Boston, MA). TIMI-3 flow was noted and no significant residual stenosis remained (). After the procedure, daily oral DAPT of clopidogrel 75 mg and aspirin (ASA) 300 mg were prescribed. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist tirofiban was initially given as rapid intravenous infusion at a rate of 0.4 μg/kg/min for 30 min. Upon completion of the initial infusion, the rate is decreased to 0.15 μg/kg/min delivered as continuous infusion for about 36 h.\nApproximately 2 h after the end of tirofiban administration, the patient developed severe chest pain and T-wave pseudonormalization in the anterior leads on ECG. He was immediately moved to the catheterization lab for repeat coronary angiography (CAG) and ST was found in LAD (). In consideration of the possibility of a dissection at the proximal stent edge (), an additional SES of Partner 3.0 × 21 mm (Lepu Medical, Beijing, China) was deployed, overlapping the previous proximal stent edge, with an excellent final result (). Then, Partner 4.0 × 15 mm (Lepu Medical, Beijing, China) and Taxus 4.0 × 38 mm (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) were implanted in the distal and proximal segment of RCA, respectively (). The patient’s clopidogrel dose was increased to 75 mg twice a day because he was found to be hyporesponsive to clopidogrel when tested for adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation utilizing with light transmission aggregometry (LTA). He did not taking any drugs that could deteriorate the platelet function, including proton pump inhibitor. Tirofiban was given as continuous infusion for about 72 h. The patient had an uneventful recovery in the following 5 days.\nUnfortunately, the patient again underwent severe chest pain in the sixth day after the second PCI, and the ECG showed ST-segment elevation in V1-V5 leads (). Misgiving about the uncertainty of the reason for recurrent ST, surgeons refused to perform coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After failure of initial thrombolytic therapy, he underwent emergent salvage angiography by a different interventionalist. Emergency CAG showed total occlusion of the mid-LAD due to ST (). Thrombi were aspirated with the Diver CE aspiration catheter (Invatec, Brescia, Italy). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) revealed inadequate stent expansion due to elastic recoil (). This was repaired by repeated high-pressure post-dilation with 3.0 × 12 mm and 3.5 × 15 mm NC Sprinter balloons (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) (). Despite the double dose of clopidogrel therapy, ADP-induced platelet aggregation showed that she was still hyporesponsive to clopidogrel. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery and was discharged 1 week later with triple anti-platelet therapy (aspirin 300 mg qd, clopidogrel 75 mg bid, and cilostazol 100 mg bid).\nThe patient’s chest pain recurred again 6 days thereafter. Repeat emergent CAG revealed patent RCA stents and total occlusion of the mid-LAD due to ST (). Surgeons still refused to perform CABG for this patient. Diver CE aspiration catheter (Invatec, Brescia, Italy) was used again. Given the possibility of a dissection at the distal stent edge (), we deployed another SES of Firebird (MicroPort Medical, Shanghai, China) 2.5 × 29 mm in distal-LAD, overlapping the previous distal stent edge. The final result revealed no residual stenosis or dissection and excellent TIMI-3 flow (). Upon completion of continuous infusion of tirofiban for about 7 days, the patient was discharged. He was hemodynamically stable and symptom-free at the time of discharge. Echocardiogram revealed a decreased LVEF of 48%. Laboratory retest showed low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 1.6 mmol/L, creatinine of 96 μmol/L, and fasting plasma glucose of 6.02 mmol/L. Although the patient has complied strictly with the triple anti-platelet therapy (aspirin 300 mg qd, clopidogrel 75 mg bid, and cilostazol 100 mg bid), ADP-induced platelet aggregation showed that she was still hyporesponsive to clopidogrel. Given the very complicated recent course, no further interventions were undertaken.

His functional capacity was higher than 4 metabolic equivalents and he had no previous experience of general anesthesia. Preoperative evaluation showed a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and no specific lung lesion was found by chest radiography. There was no abnormal finding in a pulmonary function test or in conventional laboratory exams. Preoperative thallium single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) detected a perfusion defect on the inferior wall, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a moderate degree of akinesia on the inferior wall. Both of these findings in thallium SPECT and TTE were detected for 8 years after the previous attack with no development of new ischemic lesions.\nWhen the patient arrived in the operation room, his blood pressure (BP; systolic/diastolic), heart rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were 166/94 mmHg, 76 beats/min, and 99% respectively. Preoxygenation with 80% oxygen was performed followed by intravenous administration of midazolam 2 mg and lidocaine 20 mg. Induction was started with a target controlled infusion (TCI; Asan Pump, version 2.0, BionetCo., Seoul, Korea) of propofol and remifentanil at 2 µg/ml and 3 ng/ml, respectively. Cisatracurium (12 mg) was administered and mask-valve ventilation was started after the patient lost his spontaneous breathing. During mask ventilation, a depression in ST segment of more than 3 mm was detected in ECG, and difficulty in manual ventilation was noted. Propofol and remifentanil infusion were immediately stopped, and the patient was promptly intubated followed by ventilation with 100% oxygen. A few minutes later, SpO2 rapidly decreased and his BP, initially 128/78 mmHg, dropped to 64/42 mmHg. Although vasoactive drugs including phenylephrine and epinephrine were administered, the BP continued to decrease to an undetectable level by a noninvasive BP cuff. Direct arterial pressure was monitored, and a central venous catheter was inserted to maintain fluid therapy and continuous drug administration. The patient quickly developed ventricular fibrillation and we thus initiated a sequential algorithm of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR). Immediate defibrillation (200J) followed by manual chest compression was performed with repeated intravenous administration of atropine (0.5 mg) and epinephrine (1 mg). A portable transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was obtained 20 minutes after CPCR was initiated, which showed global hypokinesia in the myocardial wall with akinesia in the inferior wall. However, the patient had not return of spontaneous circulation for 40 minutes, and the patient showed repeated ventricular fibrillation refractory to defibrillation. An emergent consultation of cardiac surgeons was requested to apply veno-arterial type extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to substitute cardiac function. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and remained intubated during the application of ECMO. In the ICU, sequential laboratory tests including cardiac enzymes were performed. Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient's serum troponin-I and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels were 6.292 ng/ml and 34.6 ng/ml respectively, and within 5 hours they were increased to 44.099 ng/ml and 107.3 ng/ml. After 8 hours of ICU admission, 12-lead ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block. On the same day, the patient had return of drowsy consciousness level from comatose state.

The patient presented with dyspnea, lower extremity edema and some wounds over bilateral ankles area for 1 day before admission, but had no other symptoms, including a headache, sore throat, cough, and chest, abdominal, and back pain. He had alcohol and chronic hepatitis C- related liver cirrhosis, and took diuretics in the past 5 years. He drank approximately 60 g of alcohol per day for more than 20 years, but recently had been taking a bit more than usual.\nHis laboratory data 2 weeks before admission were 6.5 mg/ dl of total bilirubin, 2.1 g/dl of albumin, and 1.73 of international normalized ratio. In addition, he had moderate ascites, which was medically controlled. These findings were indicative of Child- Pugh class C liver cirrhosis. On arrival, he appeared to be in disturbance and distress that was classified as 13 (E3V4M6) on the Glasgow Coma Scale. His vital signs were 132/106 mmHg of blood pressure, 125 beats/minute of pulse rate, 24 breaths/minute of respiratory rate, and 38.4 °C of body temperature. Auscultation of the lung and heart revealed coarse breath sounds and rapid irregular heartbeats. His abdomen was soft and swollen. Two wounds with redness and swelling (measures 0.5 × 0.5 cm, left ankle; measures 1 × 1 cm, right ankle) were found on his lower extremities ( and ). Chest X-ray indicated a lower lobe infiltration and a mild blunting of C-P angle in the right side (). ECG showed atrial fibrillation.\nLaboratory findings also included 8,990/ml of white blood cell count with 94% neutrophils and 3% lymphocytes, 11.1 g/dl of hemoglobin level, 104,000/ml of platelet count, 23 mg/dl of blood urea nitrogen, 1.42 mg/dl of creatinine, 121 mmol/L of sodium, and 4.6 mmol/L of potassium. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrated 152 cells/mm3 of ascitic white blood cell count and 30 cells/mm3 of polymorphonuclear cell count 10 hours later after his arrival of emergency department. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated a severe metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.38, pCO2: 20.4 mmHg, pO2: 91.8 mmHg; base deficit: 11.2 mmol/L), which was indicative of septic shock.\nOxacillin treatment under the impression of cellulitis was administered 2 hours after his arrival; two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Rapid fluid resuscitation was performed and immediately developed by tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Although there was no significant change of ankle wounds, antibiotic regimen with a combination of ceftriaxone and clindamycin was adjusted due to persistent hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation and high dose vasopressor use and clinical suspicion of Vibrio vulnificus related necrotizing fasciitis.\nOne episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with manifestations of fresh blood in the nasogastric tube occurred on Day 2.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion.

He had a prior history of cerebral infarctions (x3) at the age of 66, 74 and 75 years, with a first instance of swallowing difficulties after the third stroke. At that time, dysphasia rehabilitation was initiated within 3 days of the stroke, and he recovered the ability to eat a regular meal within 2 weeks. In January 2018, 1-year after his last stroke, he underwent surgery for spinal stenosis, followed by a 10-day period of bedrest. His physical activity level subsequently declined due to back pain, and he lost 10 kg within the 10 months after surgery. Swallowing difficulties re-emerged in September 2018, with the patient only able to tolerate soft meals. His dysphasia worsened, with an increase in sputum and development of a chronic cough.\nHis medical history included cerebral infarctions (x3), diabetes mellitus, spinal stenosis, and hypertension. His height was 168.8 cm, with a body weight of 56.5 kg. He had a right hemiplegia, with the following functional measures: grip strength, 25 kg; gait speed, 0.7 m/s, assessed using the 5-m walk test; and skeletal mass index, 6.6 kg/m2. His score of 5 points on the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form was indicative of malnourishment. Absence of another cerebral infarct was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Video-endoscopic swallowing assessment showed saliva pooling in the pharynx, widening of the pharyngeal space, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A). Video-fluorography revealed a decrease in the forward movement of the larynx, a widened pharyngeal space, weakened pharyngeal constriction, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A–C). Functional swallowing scores were as follows: Hyodo score, 9; Fujishima grade, 6; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 4. A probable diagnosis of sarcopenic dysphagia was made, based on the criteria defined by Mori et al. [] Clinical management included swallowing training, a high-protein diet, and nutritional guidance. The patient declined additional rehabilitation, due to his previous experience post-stroke. Therefore, we presented laryngeal suspension as a possible alternative treatment, which was performed in December 2018.\nLaryngeal suspension was performed via a minimally invasive thyromadibulopexy, using two skin incisions: one (2-cm) incision at the level of the mandible and the other (3-cm) between the hyoid bone and the superior border of the thyroid cartilage (A). Identified the white line, divided aside the anterior cervical muscles, and exposed the thyroid cartilage. Also the mandible was exposed. Two holes in the mandibular and six holes in the thyroid cartilage was made by using drill. The thyroid cartilage was fixed to the mandible using No. 2 nylon. No. 2 nylon thread was passed through the Gore-tex sheet cut to the size of thyroid cartilage. And it was passed through the thyroid cartilage, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, mandible, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, and tied to the other side of the nylon. As the two holes of the middle of the thyroid cartilage, two No. 2 nylons was crossed to fix the thyroid cartilage and mandible. The larynx was suspended about one vertebral body by totally using five No. 2 nylons (B), confirmed by X-ray fluoroscopy. A 1-cm incision was performed for tracheotomy, and cuffed tracheal cannula was inserted for airway management.\nMaintaining some neck flexion for a period of 1-week was conducted. Nutritional support was initiated via gastrostomy tube feeding. The cuffed tracheal cannula was changed to an uncuffed cannula on postoperative day (POD) 1. The wound was stable and there was no pain. Swallowing was initiated using jelly and cold tea, with the patient in a flat lateral position. The tracheal cannula was removed on POD 4. Video-fluorography revealed contrast agent residue in the vallecular but with a decrease in residue in the pyriform sinus compared to pre-operative measures, with no evidence of aspiration on POD 6 (A–C). Anterosuperior movement of the larynx was improved, reaching one vertebral level higher than before surgery. The swallowing reflex was maintained, with sufficient opening of the esophageal orifice, avoiding the need for mandibular protrusion to swallow. Swallowing using modified food was initiated in a sitting position on POD 6 and the gastrostomy tube was removed on POD 7. Video-endoscopic examination confirmed his ability to eat a rice cracker and noodles without aspiration and no evidence of pharyngeal residue on POD 11 (B). The patient was able to eat soft meals on POD 14, and a regular meal on POD 18, and was discharged on POD 21. The patient gained 2 kg in the 2 months after surgery, with improvement in functional scores: Hyodo score, 5; Fujishima grade, 8; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 6. There was no exacerbation of the condition over a 10-month period after surgery, and the patient has a normal diet and is able to travel.

He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.\nHe had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.\nThe patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).\nCardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device.

Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875/125 mg twice daily for 5 days was prescribed empirically. The symptoms of tonsillitis resolved within five-day treatment, however, four days after completing the course of antibiotic therapy, sore throat, more prominent on the left side, reappeared. Two days later the patient presented to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of worsening sore throat, painful swallowing and fever. The patient was previously well, with no history of chronic diseases, recurrent tonsillitis or previous peritonsillar abscess. Seven months previously she gave birth to her second child and was still breastfeeding the baby. She denied smoking. On physical examination her temperature was 38°C, pulse rate: 80 beats/min, respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min and blood pressure: 120/80 mm Hg. Examination of the oral cavity and oropharynx showed enlarged and inflamed left tonsil as well as congested and bulging soft palate on the left side with contralateral displacement of the uvula. Both tonsils were covered with whitish exudate. No dental caries was noted. There was also bilateral, moderately tender submandibular lymphadenopathy. The remainder of physical examination was unremarkable. Blood tests results are shown in Table . Separate swabs were obtained from the surfaces of both tonsils. Next, under local anesthesia, diagnostic needle aspiration of left tonsil was performed by otolaryngologist, during which scanty amount of pus was obtained. This initial procedure was followed by incision and drainage. Tonsil swabs and abscess aspirate were sent to laboratory for microbiological examination. The patient refused hospitalization at the Otolaryngology Department, thus was discharged home on a 10-day course of cefuroxime (500 mg twice daily) and metronidazole (500 mg 3 times daily) with recommendation to discontinue breastfeeding for the duration of the antibiotic therapy and to present at follow-up visit to Otolaryngology Clinic after completing antibiotic therapy. The symptoms of peritonsillar abscess as well as fever were subsiding steadily during treatment, however on the last day of antibiotic therapy, swelling and pain of the left ankle appeared, thus the patient presented to her family doctor. Upon presentation she was afebrile and had marked oedema and pain of her left ankle. Her heart rate was 72 beats/min, she did not have an appreciable cardiac murmur. Her chest was clear to auscultation. Antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime (500 mg once daily) for next 5 days was prescribed, as well as pain relief medication with paracetamol. After completing antibiotic therapy the patient presented at follow-up visit to Otolaryngology Clinic. She was afebrile, with normal vital signs. Examination of oropharynx showed resolution of both, congestion and oedema of left tonsil and soft palate. There was no exudate on the tonsils. Cultures of throat swabs and abscess aspirate collected 2 weeks before revealed the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes in all three materials. According to the patient report, left ankle swelling with which she presented to her family doctor, resolved within 4 days. Upon presentation the patient only had moderate pain in the joint. She was consulted by rheumatologist. Her heart rate was 70 beats/min. She did not have a regurgitant murmur. Her chest was clear to auscultation. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer was evaluated and proved to be 412 IU/ml (normal 0–200 IU/ml). The level of C-reactive protein was 13,0 mg/L. Control throat swabs were collected for culture, which revealed normal oropharynx flora. The patient was recommended to continue pain relief medication with paracetamol and present at follow-up visit to Rheumatology Clinic after 2 weeks. Her only complaint was persisting slight pain in left ankle joint. The results of physical examination were analogous to those observed at previous follow-up. ASO titer was 503 IU/ml. Control throat swabs were collected and culture yielded normal flora. The patient was recommended to present at follow-up visit at Rheumatology Clinic after 2 months. At that time, she was well. Ankle pain, according to the patient report, disappeared shortly after last visit. The results of physical examination were analogous to those observed previously. ASO titer was 396 IU/ml. Six months after the presentation at Emergency Department, the patient was well, with ASO titer reaching 262 IU/ml. Table summarizes the chronology of clinical findings and blood tests results.\nCultures of PTA aspirate revealed Streptococcus pyogenes as a predominant species as well as Prevotella oralis and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Tonsil swabs, collected at the time the patient presented with PTA, yielded copious growth of Streptococcus pyogenes as well as normal throat flora, namely Streptococcus viridians, Neisseria spp, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Two control throat swabs revealed only normal oropharynx flora.

Antimicrobial susceptibility results were interpreted according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing recommendations (EUCAST 2013, version 3.1) []. Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from tonsil swabs and abscess aspirate demonstrated identical susceptibility patterns.

Neurological examination conducted revealed the patient to have full consciousness with a Glasgow Coma Score at 15. Laboratory results indicated an elevation in creatinine level, documented at 1.4 mg/dL, suggestive of some level of renal impairment, and a white blood cell count of 7300 count/µL. Electrolyte analysis showed sodium level of 138 mEq/L and a potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.34 in conjunction with a patient maintaining a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) of 77 mm Hg on a supplementary FiO₂ of 46 %.

Symptoms initiated three days prior to admission with a severe abrupt-onset entire left lower extremity pain and claudication not relieved by analgesics. He had a 10 pack-year history of cigarette smoking and a multipartner sexual relationship. Otherwise, his medical history showed a healthy young man up to the present illness. The patient’s family history was unremarkable for thrombophilia. In physical examination, he was afebrile with a good general appearance and his blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate were 120/80 mmHg, 100 bpm and 16/min, respectively. His left lower extremity was cold from knee down and bluish discoloration of digits was noted.\nLeft femoral artery pulse was undetectable as well as its subsequent branches. Sensory and motor functions of the entire left lower extremity were intact. Other parts of physical examination had normal findings except for an oral aphthous lesion and a healing genital ulcer with a negative Pathergy test. Color-Doppler sonography of the left lower extremity arteries revealed a thrombus in the left common iliac artery, 5 cm in length, initiating from the abdominal aorta bifurcation. Trivial blood flow in the common iliac artery and decreased blood flow in the lower branches were found, so that the blood flow velocity was 27 cm/sec in the left common femoral artery compared to 58 cm/sec velocity of the normal opposite side. Evaluation of distal arteries including anterior and posterior tibialis arteries demonstrated a complete thrombosis in the lower halves of both with no blood flow. Anticoagulant therapy was promptly initiated and Fogarty catheter was inserted for proximal thrombectomy. After the operation, the patient’s end extremity was warm and he felt no pain anymore. Weak pulses of both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis arteries were also detectable. Forty-eight hours later, the patient developed another episode of cold end extremity and pulselessness in the same limb. In color-doppler sonography, despite establishment of triphasic blood flow of the left lower extremity arteries up to midpart of distal arteries, no flow was detected in the distal halves of anterior and posterior tibialis arteries due to an embolus/thrombus. Therefore, the patient underwent Fogarty insertion for thrombectomy again. After the second surgery, all previous symptoms and signs were removed and follow-up CT-angiography revealed normal course and caliber of all the arteries of the left lower extremity with no evidence of collateral formation in favor of chronic vascular insufficiency. Meanwhile, to find out the reason of recurrent thromboembolic events in an otherwise healthy young man, an extensive work-up was performed. Lab investigation revealed a CBC with Hg of 16.7 g/dL, WBC of 7000/mm3 and platelet count of 179000/mm3. PT, INR and PTT were 13 seconds, 1 and 25 seconds, respectively. Lipid profile showed total cholesterol of 202 gr/dL, TG of 146 gr/dL, HDL-c of 37 gr/dL and LDL-c of 136 gr/dL. Serum levels of antiphospholipid-antibodies, anticardiolipin antibody (ACLA), P- and C-ANCA and anti-β2 glycoprotein IgM and IgG were all within the normal ranges. Liver function test showed no abnormality and viral markers for hepatitis B and C had negative results. Homocysteine level was normal and LDH was 445 IU/L. Coagulation factor assay revealed no abnormal findings and results were not in favor of protein C/S or antithrombin deficiency. Investigations showed no factor V Leiden gene mutation. Other blood tests had normal findings. Regarding proximal involvement of lower extremity arteries, abdomen pelvic sonography, helical chest and abdomenopelvic CT-scan demonstrated no mass, organomegally or the third space fluid collection. EKG (electrocardiography) and trans esophageal echocardiography (TEE) excluded any cardiogenic source of emboli. Ultimately, we found a reactive HIV Ab ELISA with the same result in repetition. Western blot test confirmed the diagnosis of HIV infection. The patient was then discharged with antiplatelet and anticoagulant and referred to a HIV center to receive medical support. In outpatient follow-up, endogenous anticoagulants were rechecked two weeks after the acute phase with all results within the normal limits.\n\nWhat is the patient's Wells' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis?\n\nA 27-year-old man from Yasuj (central part of Iran) was hospitalized from 5th to 18th of March 2012 in surgery ward of Nemazee Teaching Hospital, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, due to intermittent episodes of acute lower extremity arterial thrombosis. Symptoms initiated three days prior to admission with a severe abrupt-onset entire left lower extremity pain and claudication not relieved by analgesics. He had a 10 pack-year history of cigarette smoking and a multipartner sexual relationship. Otherwise, his medical history showed a healthy young man up to the present illness. The patient’s family history was unremarkable for thrombophilia. In physical examination, he was afebrile with a good general appearance and his blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate were 120/80 mmHg, 100 bpm and 16/min, respectively. His left lower extremity was cold from knee down and bluish discoloration of digits was noted.\nLeft femoral artery pulse was undetectable as well as its subsequent branches. Sensory and motor functions of the entire left lower extremity were intact. Other parts of physical examination had normal findings except for an oral aphthous lesion and a healing genital ulcer with a negative Pathergy test. Color-Doppler sonography of the left lower extremity arteries revealed a thrombus in the left common iliac artery, 5 cm in length, initiating from the abdominal aorta bifurcation. Trivial blood flow in the common iliac artery and decreased blood flow in the lower branches were found, so that the blood flow velocity was 27 cm/sec in the left common femoral artery compared to 58 cm/sec velocity of the normal opposite side. Evaluation of distal arteries including anterior and posterior tibialis arteries demonstrated a complete thrombosis in the lower halves of both with no blood flow. Anticoagulant therapy was promptly initiated and Fogarty catheter was inserted for proximal thrombectomy. After the operation, the patient’s end extremity was warm and he felt no pain anymore. Weak pulses of both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis arteries were also detectable. Forty-eight hours later, the patient developed another episode of cold end extremity and pulselessness in the same limb. In color-doppler sonography, despite establishment of triphasic blood flow of the left lower extremity arteries up to midpart of distal arteries, no flow was detected in the distal halves of anterior and posterior tibialis arteries due to an embolus/thrombus.

For twenty years, she has been treated for lupus and its pulmonologic and renal complications at other hospitals. Two years ago, she underwent transarterial embolization of her bronchial artery due to hemoptysis. Two month later, she visited the cardiovascular department of this hospital with severe chest pain, and underwent PCI in the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD), and its diagonal branch with a 3.0×32 mm Taxus® Express2 paclitaxel-eluting stent (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) for the mid LAD and a 2.5×24 mm Taxus® stent for the diagonal branch. Since the PCI, she has been taking aspirin, 100 mg; clopidogrel, 75 mg and cilostazol, 100 mg for coronary artery disease treatment and prednisolone, 5 mg and hydroxyquinolone for lupus treatment. On visiting the emergency department, her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in V1-V4. Her laboratory data revealed 206 ng/mL of creatine phospho kinase, 17.8 ng/mL of creatine kinase-MB level and 1.69 ng/mL of troponin-I level. She was diagnosed with an anterior-septal ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and taken immediately to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography (CAG) revealed total occlusion over the previous stent site of the mid LAD and the diagonal branch (), therefore we performed balloon angioplasty to treat the total occluded lesion of the mid LAD. However, we could not perform any intervention for the diagonal branch due to wiring failure. The final angiogram after balloon angioplasty showed thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade III flow of the LAD and moderate stenosis of the proximal LAD (). The patient was discharged without complications.\nHowever, five weeks later, the patient presented to our emergency department with severe chest pain associated with ST elevation on ECG on arrival. Under suspicion of recurrent stent thrombosis, we performed emergency CAG, which showed thrombotic re-occlusion of the LAD stent with TIMI grade 0 flow. We elected to perform balloon angioplasty and deployed a 3.0×18 mm XIENCE V stent (Abbott vascular, Redwood City, CA, USA) to cover the progressed lesion of the proximal LAD, overlapping the proximal part of the previous stent.

The ECG again showed ST elevation of the precordial lead and CAG showed stent thrombosis, similar to the previous event. However, after balloon angioplasty, multiple thrombi in the distal part of the stent and disease progression at the edge of stent were shown (). We therefore performed an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), which showed eccentric plaque with thrombi in the stent and isoechoic plaque with significant stenosis at the distal edge of the stent (). After performing the IVUS, we deployed a 3.0×30 mm Endeavor® Resolute stent (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) for this lesion, overlapping the previous stent.

The foreign body was safely removed from both the pancreas and stomach laparoscopically. The foreign body was identified as a 2.5-cm-long fish bone, (Fig. b). The length of the fish bone embedded in the pancreas was about 2 cm. There was a minor laceration at the site of the pancreatic injury. Neither fat saponification nor hematoma around the pancreas was identified. We did not perform suture repair or local debridement for the site of the pancreatic injury.

White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.\nAfter three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.\nPercutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.\nWe subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma.

Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.\n\nCalculate SIRS Criteria by summing the results of the following rules:\n    Temperature >38°C (100.4°F) or <36°C (96.8°F): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Heart rate >90: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Respiratory rate >20 or PaCO₂ <32 mm Hg: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    White blood cell count (WBC) >12,000/mm³, <4,000/mm³, or >10% bands: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point",

The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.\nOn examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.\nThe bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days).

The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST-T changes. Chest radiograph showed left perihilar parenchymal scars, surgical clips, and postoperative changes in the chest (). Other laboratory studies, including two more sets of cardiac biomarkers, were normal.\nShe underwent an exercise nuclear stress test which demonstrated indeterminate electrocardiogram (ECG) changes with a small anteroseptal wall defect which appeared to be artifactual. Following the stress test, she developed retrosternal chest pain. Although her ECG did not show any acute changes, repeat serum troponin level was elevated at 0.42 ug/L. Coronary angiography was performed and demonstrated 90% stenosis of the left main coronary artery ostium, dominant right coronary artery, and no evidence of any atherosclerotic disease or stenosis in other coronary arteries (Figures , , and ). Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55% without any regional wall motion abnormalities.\nSyntax score was calculated to be 12% which predicts comparable outcomes of surgical and angioplastic procedures. Taking into consideration patient's history that may complicate the surgical treatment including her previous surgical interventions, radiation therapy, and chemical therapy, the interventional cardiology team recommended percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the lesion. Cardiothoracic surgeons were consulted as well for further evaluation and they agreed that surgery will be challenging in this patient, but at the same time they felt that she may tolerate the surgery well, given her functional status, remission from cancer, and the low operative risk (EuroScore is 1.23%), and they suggested coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery as a reasonable option due to the high failure rate of stenting ostial lesions and to avoid the possible cardiac arrest associated with the intervention on the stenotic ostium of left main coronary artery.\nAfter discussing both treatment options, the risks and benefits of each procedure with the patient, she decided to undergo surgical revascularization. Overnight, she experienced excruciating anginal chest pain without any elevation in cardiac enzymes; as a result she was taken to surgery the next day.\nIntraoperatively she was noted to have dense adhesions surrounding the heart. As a result, she developed severe bleeding from the adhesions. Despite aggressive transfusion of red blood cells and platelets, bleeding could not be controlled and she died during surgery. The family refused to allow autopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nWhat is the patient's Wells' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis?\n\nA 60-year-old woman with a history of lung cancer currently in remission was admitted with complaints of chest pain. She had recurrent substernal chest pain, increasing in severity, without radiation or associated symptoms during the preceding week. She denied any specific alleviating or provoking factors.\nPast medical history was significant for hypertension and stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung carcinoma which was diagnosed eight years earlier. She had been treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One year later she developed a malignant pericardial effusion, treated with a pericardial window, and recurrent pleural effusions, which were drained with pleural catheters. During the next six years, she was in full remission as confirmed by annual chest computed tomography (CT). Her medications included aspirin, metoprolol, iron, vitamin B12, and gefitinib.

His medical history consisted of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and a two-thirds gastric resection performed in the 1980s. The intervention was successfully performed with an ABBOTT® Amulet 18 mm device being implanted (). After the implantation, he received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and Clopidogrel for 6 months. Approximately 5 months post-intervention, the patient expressed acute dyspnoea and called the emergency medical services (EMS).\nOn arrival of the EMS, the patient was conscious, severely distressed and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg and a heart rate of 90/min. Peripheral oxygen saturation of 85% measured percutaneously was noted. After the administration of bronchodilator medication for a presumed COPD exacerbation, the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated with a resultant cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity. The patient received cardiopulmonary resuscitation including chest compressions, endotracheal intubation, and the administration of 3 mg Adrenaline. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred approximately 10 min later at which point he was transferred to a local hospital. During the transport, the cardiocirculatory parameters were relatively stable with a systolic pressure around 100 mmHg. The capnometry after return of spontaneous circulation measured a pCO2 of 60 mmHg. Upon arrival at the hospital, the physical examination showed jugular vein distension but no peripheral oedema.\nEchocardiography performed in the emergency department revealed a pericardial tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis via the subxiphoidal route, 800 mL of blood were initially evacuated. The differential diagnosis included primary respiratory failure or a sudden cardiac death with secondary pericardial effusion induced by cardiac compressions under double antiplatelet therapy, a ruptured aortic aneurysm, a myocardial rupture, or a primary laceration of a cardiac structure by the LAA occluder. A ruptured aneurysm of the ascending aorta was excluded by ultrasound. Electrocardiogram examination did not demonstrate any ST-segment elevation or low voltage. Blood gas analysis documented a stable respiratory situation with a pO2 of 230 mmHg and a pCO2 of 55 mmHg, the pH was 7, 3 and Lactate elevated with 10 mmol/L (<2 mmol/L). The haemoglobin was measured at 9 g/dL (12–16 g/dL). The chest X-ray demonstrated the proper placement of the endotracheal and pericardial tube and ruled out a pneumothorax or pulmonary oedema.\nIn the hours following pericardiocentesis, approximately 2 L of blood were evacuated. Conventional methods of coagulopathy management including application of tranexamic acid, fresh frozen plasma, and fibrinogen did not stop the bleeding. To stabilize the patient a total of eight packs of red blood cells were transfused.\nIn preparation of cardiac surgery, a coronary angiogram was performed (). It revealed active leakage of contrast agent in the proximal circumflex artery and the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery department immediately. Intra-operatively a perforation of the tissue at the basis of the LAA close to the left main coronary artery was discovered. Under protection of cold blood cardioplegia on cardiopulmonary bypass the occluder was excised through the opened left atrium. The LAA was closed by endocardial sutures and two pledget sutures were used to seal the epicardial lesion at the LAA basis which stopped the bleeding. Fortunately, after prolonged treatment in the intensive care unit and weaning ward the patient was discharged and alive 4 months after the event without neurological deficit and on ASA monotherapy.

Prior triggers for the patient’s cold urticaria included consuming ice chips, being in cold environments and colonoscopy bowel preparation. She was also allergic to naproxen, guaifenesin, and menthol. Her previous cold exposures had led to complications as varied as extremity numbness to airway compromise, anaphylaxis, and cardiac arrest.\nHer home medications included escitalopram, pramipexole, cetirizine, and ranitidine. Her surgical history consisted of a cesarean delivery and cholecystectomy, both prior to the diagnosis of cold urticaria. Neither she nor her family had a history of adverse reactions to anesthesia. At presentation for surgery, the patient’s physical exam was unremarkable, including a Mallampati class II oropharynx.

The patient could not tolerate oral nutrition and became severely malnourished, and a PICC line was placed for TPN in December 2017. Chronic TPN use led to recurrent candidemia with blood cultures growing Candida albicans resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole. Over several months, her PICC line was replaced thrice, and she was ultimately treated with micafungin. The patient had multiple admissions over the past few months for workup of altered mental status and unsteady gait. Her other past medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus treated with mycophenolate mofetil and hydroxychloroquine, left portal vein branch thrombosis on enoxaparin therapy, type 2 diabetes mellitus not on insulin, fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety. She presented to our hospital in July 2018 with complaints of tremors, impaired mobility, confusion, gait instability, falls, and lethargy.\nOn admission, she was noted to be confused, with horizontal nystagmus and dilated pupils as well as bradypnea. Dilated fundus examination was indicative of candida retinitis. She was lethargic but arousable. Her speech was difficult to understand, and the history of presenting illness was provided primarily by the patient's mother who relayed to the team that she had been having tremors, episodes of confusion, and numerous falls for the past several months. Her mother also noticed that she had increased irritability and emotional lability during this time. She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit for airway management due to her acute encephalopathy. Due to a lack of meningeal signs, a lumbar puncture was not performed.\nThe infectious disease service was consulted, and she was started on liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine for a total of 6 weeks. MRI brain showed worsening T1 hyperintensities from June 2018 to July 2018 in the bilateral globus pallidi, as evidenced by the arrows in Figures and , which were thought to be secondary to manganese toxicity from chronic TPN use. Furthermore, a repeat MRI brain was performed in August 2018, one month after discontinuation of TPN, which showed improvement of the T1 hyperintensities in the bilateral globus pallidi, as evidenced by the white arrows in , approaching the intensity level noted in June 2018. Other supporting findings included T1 hyperintensities in the substantia nigra, as evidenced by the arrows in , and decreased signal in the bilateral globus pallidi on T2-weighted images, as evidenced by the arrows in . With antifungal treatment and cessation of TPN, her mentation and neurological symptoms improved within 3-4 days of cessation of TPN.\nGeneral surgery was consulted for gastrostomy tube placement in her remnant stomach, as the patient was unable to consume more than 500 calories by mouth per day due to complaints of nausea and vomiting. Although our patient presented to the hospital seven months after initiation of TPN therapy, her Parkinsonian symptoms had begun to manifest after three months on TPN.\n\nWhat is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?\n\nOur patient is a 38-year-old woman with a past medical history most significant for a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in March 2017, complicated by a marginal ulcer at the anastomosis site with subsequent perforation. The patient could not tolerate oral nutrition and became severely malnourished, and a PICC line was placed for TPN in December 2017. Chronic TPN use led to recurrent candidemia with blood cultures growing Candida albicans resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole. Over several months, her PICC line was replaced thrice, and she was ultimately treated with micafungin. The patient had multiple admissions over the past few months for workup of altered mental status and unsteady gait. Her other past medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus treated with mycophenolate mofetil and hydroxychloroquine, left portal vein branch thrombosis on enoxaparin therapy, type 2 diabetes mellitus not on insulin, fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety. She presented to our hospital in July 2018 with complaints of tremors, impaired mobility, confusion, gait instability, falls, and lethargy.\nOn admission, she was noted to be confused, with horizontal nystagmus and dilated pupils as well as bradypnea. Dilated fundus examination was indicative of candida retinitis. She was lethargic but arousable. Her speech was difficult to understand, and the history of presenting illness was provided primarily by the patient's mother who relayed to the team that she had been having tremors, episodes of confusion, and numerous falls for the past several months. Her mother also noticed that she had increased irritability and emotional lability during this time. She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit for airway management due to her acute encephalopathy. Due to a lack of meningeal signs, a lumbar puncture was not performed.\nThe infectious disease service was consulted, and she was started on liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine for a total of 6 weeks. MRI brain showed worsening T1 hyperintensities from June 2018 to July 2018 in the bilateral globus pallidi, as evidenced by the arrows in Figures and , which were thought to be secondary to manganese toxicity from chronic TPN use. Furthermore, a repeat MRI brain was performed in August 2018, one month after discontinuation of TPN, which showed improvement of the T1 hyperintensities in the bilateral globus pallidi, as evidenced by the white arrows in , approaching the intensity level noted in June 2018.

She had no audible murmurs and the rest of her examination was unremarkable.\nChest X-ray was normal and ECG showed sinus rhythm with a rate of 76 beats per minute and first-degree AV block. One set of blood cultures and urine cultures were sent and she was started on IV piperacillin/tazobactam for pyrexia of unknown origin. She was tested for influenza by PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab, which was negative.\nTransthoracic echocardiography (TTE), carried out on day 2 of admission, demonstrated a mass on the aortic valve, which was further characterized by trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TOE), identifying a 1.8×0.9 cm mass with thickening of the aortic root, suspicious for root abscess.\nOn day 2 of admission, when the TTE raised the suspicion of endocarditis, she had seven further sets of blood cultures sent over a period of 72 h and was changed to IV amoxicillin 2 g 4 hourly, and gentamicin 3 mg kg−1 OD, as empirical treatment for native valve infective endocarditis.\nShe was transferred to cardiac surgery on day 4 of admission and underwent aortic valve replacement surgery (). Procedure note from Cardiothoracics as follows: ‘Via oblique aortotomy, tri-leaflet valve was seen with a huge vegetation and perforation at the annulus. There was a small abscess cavity in the annulus at the non-coronary cusp. The native valve was excised, and the cavity was debrided easily, with rifampicin washout.

She also complained of some pelvic discomfort that resembled menstrual cramps, but denied overt vaginal bleeding. Her past medical history was significant for osteoporosis diagnosed twelve years prior. She denied any history of ovarian or adrenal disease. She denied any use of medications. The patient’s age of menarche was at 12 years and menopause at the age of 50 years. The patient’s last Pap smear was a year ago which was normal and she also reported no history of abnormal pap smears. The patient reported three normal pregnancies with uneventful cesarean sections and three living healthy children. Surgical history was remarkable for tonsillectomy and rhinoplasty. She was a happily married homemaker and exercised regularly. Interestingly, she noted an increased exercise tolerance and reported that she could easily double her normal biking routine. She also reported an increased libido. She denied tobacco, alcohol, or intravenous drug use. Family history was significant for hypertension in her mother and cardiovascular disease in her father. The subject provided written informed consent for us to use un-identifying photos of her affected areas. Physical exam was notable for marked facial stubble subsequent to shaving (Figure ) and diffuse terminal hair across her chest and abdomen. There was also some regression in the patient’s hairline (Figure ). There was no acanthosis nigricans present. Physical exam also revealed unique changes (Figure ) in 8 of her fingernails (described below), however the toenails were normal. Cliteromegaly measuring 2 cm was observed on pelvic exam. The remainder of the physical exam was otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory studies showed an extremely high total testosterone and androstenedione level at 742 ng/dl (reference range: < 62 ng/dL) and 339.0 ng/dL (20-75 ng/dL) respectively. Serum DHEA sulfate 174.2 mcg/dL (<15 - 157 mcg/dL), TSH 1.6 μIU/mL (0.5 - 4.70 μIU/mL), calcium 9.9 mg/dL (8.8 - 10.3 mg/dL), and parathyroid hormone levels 44.2 pg/ml (11 - 54 pg/ml) were all within normal reference range. The serum estradiol level was slightly elevated at 54 pg/mL (0 to 30 pg/mL; postmenopausal) (Table ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a 3.5 cm left ovarian mass with normal appearing adrenal glands. This was subsequently confirmed by ultrasound which revealed an enlarged hypoechoic left ovarian mass of 3.6 × 3.5× 3.6 cm, and normal right ovary measuring 1.9 × 2.1 × 1.7 cm. Her uterus was normal in size, measuring 5.8 × 2.6 × 4.8 cm. But, the endometrial lining was heterogeneous and thickened, measuring at 9 mm. Preoperative and intraoperative consultation with our gynecological oncology team was conducted. The patient was referred for surgical removal of the ovarian mass. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal washings, and dilation and curettage were performed. At the time of surgery, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterine cutterings were sent for intra-operative frozen section pathology consultation. The frozen section of the left ovary revealed features of a “sex cord stromal tumor”. The right ovary was atrophic measuring 1.9 × 2.1 × 1.7 cm. The frozen section analysis of uterine curettings revealed no signs of atypia or malignancy. Lymph node dissection was not warranted based on preoperative and intraoperative evaluation as well as frozen section histological consultation showing a well-contained lesion within the ovary.\nThe final pathology report revealed a left ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor measuring 2.5× 2.0×1.4 cm. The tumor was composed primarily of Leydig cells, without well-formed Sertoli cell tubules or cord (Figure A). High-power (40×) fields revealed primarily sheets and aggregates of Leydig cells in a dense fibrous stroma (Figure B). Sertoli cells were difficult to identify. Immuno-histochemical stains for Keratin 8/18 or CAM 5.2 staining was mixed, strong to weak (Figure C). Both Keratin AE1/AE3 (Figure D) and Wilms tumor gene(WT-1) stains revealed negative to weak staining of Leydig cells and were positive for those considered as Sertoli cells. Negative staining of all cells for Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) (Figure E) and diffuse, positive staining of all the cells for CD99, Calretinin, and alpha Inhibin, (Figure F) was observed, consistent with the pattern for both Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Peritoneal washings were negative for tumor cells. The patient had a normal postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital on the first postoperative day in good condition.\nThe patient returned for a series of postoperative follow up visits. The first was one week post-surgery and then every three months for a total of one full year.\nInterestingly, careful exam of this patient pre-operatively revealed unique fingernail changes. The patient stated that she observed these changes months prior to presentation in the clinic. The nails looked mostly flat with significant curved concave spoon shaped ends. This was observed in most (8/10) fingers. The changes were particularly impressive in the index and middle fingers on both hands (Figure ). An extensive review of the literature did not reveal similar findings in SLCT cases reported before nor any other female endocrinopathy. It is possible that previous cases of SLCT-induced hyperandrogenemia may have overlooked these nail findings. The only condition that leads to similar findings is iron-deficiency anemia. Although patient hemoglobin levels were always within the normal reference range, detailed iron-deficiency anemia work up was performed (Table ) and was all within normal limits. Importantly, the fingernail changes started to gradually reverse after the curative surgery and normalization of patient hormonal profile (Table ). The post-surgery reversal of nail changes (Figure ) led us to confidently conclude that the nail signs were secondary to hyperandrogenemia. As this was the first association between fingernail changes and hyperandrogenemia, we propose these changes to be named the “Al-Hendy” nail sign.\nSince androgens mediate all their cellular biological effects through its androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear steroid receptor superfamily [], we assumed that the fingernail area must express AR. We then decided to examine this concept ourselves. After appropriate IRB approval from Meharry Medical College, we collected nail bed tissues from healthy female volunteers and processed them for AR immunohistochemistry as described in Materials and Methods Section.\n\nWhat is the patient's HEART score?\n\nWe present the case of a 63-year-old post-menopausal G3P3003 Caucasian female presenting with complaints of progressively increased hair growth, deepening voice, and a receding hairline over the past year.

The patient had a normal postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital on the first postoperative day in good condition.\nThe patient returned for a series of postoperative follow up visits. The first was one week post-surgery and then every three months for a total of one full year.\nInterestingly, careful exam of this patient pre-operatively revealed unique fingernail changes. The patient stated that she observed these changes months prior to presentation in the clinic. The nails looked mostly flat with significant curved concave spoon shaped ends. This was observed in most (8/10) fingers. The changes were particularly impressive in the index and middle fingers on both hands (Figure ). An extensive review of the literature did not reveal similar findings in SLCT cases reported before nor any other female endocrinopathy. It is possible that previous cases of SLCT-induced hyperandrogenemia may have overlooked these nail findings. The only condition that leads to similar findings is iron-deficiency anemia. Although patient hemoglobin levels were always within the normal reference range, detailed iron-deficiency anemia work up was performed (Table ) and was all within normal limits. Importantly, the fingernail changes started to gradually reverse after the curative surgery and normalization of patient hormonal profile (Table ). The post-surgery reversal of nail changes (Figure ) led us to confidently conclude that the nail signs were secondary to hyperandrogenemia. As this was the first association between fingernail changes and hyperandrogenemia, we propose these changes to be named the “Al-Hendy” nail sign.\nSince androgens mediate all their cellular biological effects through its androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear steroid receptor superfamily [], we assumed that the fingernail area must express AR. We then decided to examine this concept ourselves. After appropriate IRB approval from Meharry Medical College, we collected nail bed tissues from healthy female volunteers and processed them for AR immunohistochemistry as described in Materials and Methods Section.\n\nCalculate HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events by summing the results of the following rules:\n    History: Slightly suspicious = 0 points, Moderately suspicious = +1 point, Highly suspicious = +2 points\n    EKG: Normal = 0 points, Non-specific repolarization disturbance = +1 point, Significant ST deviation = +2 points\n    Age: <45 years = 0 points, 45-64 years = +1 point, ≥65 years = +2 points\n    Risk factors (HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), smoking (current or cessation within 3 months), positive family history of cardiovascular disease before age 65, atherosclerotic disease such as prior MI, PCI/CABG, CVA/TIA, or peripheral arterial disease): No known risk factors = 0 points, 1-2 risk factors = +1 point, ≥3 risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease = +2 points\n    Initial troponin level: ≤normal limit = 0 points, 1–3× normal limit = +1 point, >3× normal limit = +2 points",

He had no specific medical or surgical history, except for a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes treated with insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, temperature of 38.4℃, heart rate of 76 beats/min, and respiration rate of 20 breaths/min. His breathing sound was clear, and his heartbeat was regular without murmurs. However, knocking tenderness in his left flank area was noted. The initial laboratory data revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14,680/mm3, hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL, platelet count of 373,000/mm3, CRP level of >12 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c level of 12.5%, indicating that his diabetes was poorly controlled. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase levels were within the normal range. Urinalysis showed white and red blood cell counts of 3–5/high-power field (HPF) and 10–15/HPF, respectively. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans showed a multifocal decreased perfusion defect of the left kidney. Blood and urine culture samples were obtained, and intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g/d) was administered immediately. His fever subsided within 72 hours, and laboratory data demonstrated improvement. Five days after admission, the initial urine and blood cultures revealed growth of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Urologic evaluation regarding bladder obstruction and screening for metastatic infection were recommended. However, the patient declined further evaluation, as his discomfort had subsided, and his poor socioeconomic status impeded the payment of additional medical costs. Eight days after admission, laboratory data demonstrated further improvement (WBC count, 8,760/mm3; CRP level, 1.95 mg/dL). Follow-up urine and blood cultures obtained on day 5 revealed no bacterial growth. The patient was therefore discharged with oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours) for 7 days. He was asked to attend the outpatient clinic for 1 month to receive maintenance ciprofloxacin, but he failed to attend.\nApproximately 1 month later, the patient presented with a 7-day history of symptoms consistent with those at his initial visit.

Bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness was noted. Laboratory data revealed a WBC count of 15,870/mm3, hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 375,000/mm3, and CRP level of >12 mg/dL. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase levels were within the normal range. Urinalysis showed a WBC count of 30–50/HPF with many bacteria and a red blood cell count of 5–10/HPF. A CT scan showed a multifocal decreased perfusion defect of both kidneys () with bladder distension. Urologic evaluation demonstrated a residual urine volume of 250 mL. Prostate-specific antigen levels were normal. He was therefore diagnosed with recurrent pyelonephritis and neurogenic bladder. An oral alpha blocking agent and intravenous ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 12 hours) were administered. Two days after readmission, his left lower flank pain persisted, despite a fentanyl patch (12 µg/h). Although there were no neurologic deficits, a neurosurgeon was consulted regarding his severe pain and the possibility of concomitant spinal disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium enhancement was performed, revealing epidural abscesses at L4–5 and paraspinal abscesses of the muscles at L3–S2 (). Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the paraspinal muscle layer was performed using an 18-gauge needle, and approximately 10 mL of yellow-white mucoid fluid was aspirated. The epidural abscesses were not drained, as there were no neurologic deficits. Cultures of blood and drained fluid revealed MSSA growth () with antimicrobial sensitivity identical to that of the initial culture. Urine cultures revealed growth of <1,000 colony forming units/mL, although the bacterial strain could not be identified. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed no evidence of infective endocarditis. Nafcillin was injected every 4 hours for 22 days. However, neutropenia occurred, and nafcillin was replaced with vancomycin for an additional 30 days. On day 57 after readmission, MRI showed the abscesses had decreased in size (). Residual urine volume was 40 mL, and no discomfort was observed. Laboratory data were nearly within the normal range (WBC count, 6,490/mm3; CRP level, 0.35 mg/dL).

The perforation closure was undertaken with a Graham omental patch. Biopsies from the ulcer margins were negative for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Bacterial culture of the abdominal fluid that was aspirated during surgery (after 36 hours of treatment with Fluconazole) revealed the growth of E. coli and Klebsiella with no residual sign of yeasts.\nAfter four days of surgery, abdominal drainage fluid Amylase was 95 U/l, significantly lower than the value recorded on the day of surgery (4717 U/l).\nThe patient was treated with Meropenem and Linezolid along with Fluconazole for 14 days and was discharged after full recovery with a given prescription of oral Omeprazole at 20 mg twice daily and H. pylori eradication therapy.\nIn the follow up visits after 1–2 weeks of discharge, Clinical and radiological examination were within normal limits with well healing abdominal surgical wound.\n\nWhat is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?\n\nA 22-year-old female was admitted to the emergency room for epigastric pain that radiated to the right and left hypochondriac regions and to the back.

The rest of the physical examination was normal.\nLaboratory tests showed elevated serum amylase level (370 U/l) so a primary diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) was made and the patient was admitted to the gastroenterology department.\nThe abdominal ultrasound revealed an intermediate amount of ascites within the abdominal cavity. Sterile ascites paracentesis was performed, the gross appearance was turbid and the chemical laboratory tests showed: glucose: 8 mg/dl, albumin: 0.5 mg/dl, LDH: 1846 UI/dl, total protein: 0.7 mg/dl, amylase: 2700 U/L. The direct cytology examination showed budding yeasts. The initial ascitic cell count couldn’t be performed because the Neubauer Counter was covered with budding yeasts, but later analysis revealed a white cell count of (7000 cell/μl). Repeated analysis to determine the exact neutrophil count reported widely variable results due to dense budding yeasts in the examined samples. However, all the reported results had a neutrophil count of (>250 cell/μl). Empirical therapy with Cefotaxime and Metronidazole was started.\nCulture was performed on Blood Agar, EMB Agar and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar. Direct examination of the growth and Germ Tube Test revealed the growth of Candida. Fluconazole was added to the empirical therapy.\nBecause our patient was young with a normal medical history, there was a high suspicion of visceral perforation as a reason for FP, so a non-enhanced abdominal CT scan due to renal impairment was performed. It revealed an abundant ascitic fluid within the peritoneal cavity and pelvis with pneumoperitoneum around the right hepatic lobe and around the spleen. (Fig. a and b).\nAn emergent laparotomy was performed. A perforated gastric ulcer in the anterior aspect of the pre-pyloric region measuring (2.5 cm) was discovered (Fig. ). The perforation closure was undertaken with a Graham omental patch. Biopsies from the ulcer margins were negative for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Bacterial culture of the abdominal fluid that was aspirated during surgery (after 36 hours of treatment with Fluconazole) revealed the growth of E. coli and Klebsiella with no residual sign of yeasts.\nAfter four days of surgery, abdominal drainage fluid Amylase was 95 U/l, significantly lower than the value recorded on the day of surgery (4717 U/l).\nThe patient was treated with Meropenem and Linezolid along with Fluconazole for 14 days and was discharged after full recovery with a given prescription of oral Omeprazole at 20 mg twice daily and H. pylori eradication therapy.\nIn the follow up visits after 1–2 weeks of discharge, Clinical and radiological examination were within normal limits with well healing abdominal surgical wound.\n\nCalculate SIRS Criteria by summing the results of the following rules:\n    Temperature >38°C (100.4°F) or <36°C (96.8°F): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Heart rate >90: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Respiratory rate >20 or PaCO₂ <32 mm Hg: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    White blood cell count (WBC) >12,000/mm³, <4,000/mm³, or >10% bands: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point",

Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.\nHe came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.\nOn exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air.

Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.\nChest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.\nHe underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.\nFollow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA).

Additionally, she reported 4-5 days of erythematous rash that began on her face and chest that then spread to her arms and abdomen (Figures -). She also reported white “spots” in her mouth. At that time, CBC, CRP, ESR, CK, and UA were within normal limits. Lipase was 675 U/L and CMP was remarkable for sodium 129 mEq/L, amino alanine transferase (ALT) 158 U/L, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 111 U/L; the rest of the CMP including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was normal. CXR was normal and abdominal radiograph showed evidence of constipation. An abdominal ultrasound was ordered due to elevated lipase and LFTs and showed no evidence of gallbladder dysfunction or liver lesions. She was diagnosed with pancreatitis, thrush, and folliculitis and was discharged home with clear liquid diet orders and prescriptions for nystatin oral solution and oral doxycycline for possible secondary skin infection. Two days later, she returned to the ED with persistent symptoms and decreased urine output. She reported nausea, constipation, and worsened dysphagia, but denied vomiting, weight change, night sweats, fever, chills, chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath. She also denied pertinent past surgeries, family history, recent travel, sexual activity, drug use, and alcohol and tobacco use. She reported allergy to penicillin. Her medication list included prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil (which she held since previous ED visit per doctor recommendations), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (T/S), nystatin oral suspension, carvedilol, ranitidine, estradiol, calcium, and vitamin D. She was told by her dermatologist not to fill the doxycycline prescription from the ED and increase the dose of T/S.\nOn physical examination, the patient was alert and oriented with normal vital signs. The exam was significant for oral thrush, but normal heart, lung, and abdominal exams. Skin exam showed a diffuse maculopapular eruption with a few vesicles on face, trunk, and extremities. Significant laboratory data was as follows: AST 1389 U/L, ALT 1570 U/L, ALP 68 U/L, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.6, and prothrombin time (PT) 18 seconds. Complete abdominal ultrasound demonstrated normal gallbladder without stones, no biliary ductal dilation, no focal liver lesions, and no ascites or abnormal fluid collections. The patient's dermatologist had performed skin biopsies 2 days prior to admission that showed multinucleated giant cells with viral inclusions suggestive of some type of herpes virus infection (Figures –). The patient was initiated on intravenous (IV) acyclovir, micafungin, vancomycin, aztreonam, and stress dose steroids for presumed disseminated herpes simplex with possible secondary bacterial infection and sepsis. Over the subsequent 48-72 hours, AST and ALT increased to the 4000s, INR increased to 1.8 and PT to 20.6. Due to worsening acute liver failure, she was transferred to our facility for liver transplant evaluation.\nOn arrival to our hospital, her skin lesions were thought to be most consistent with VZV and skin biopsy cultures from the outpatient dermatologist later confirmed VZV. IV acyclovir and antibiotics for secondary bacterial sepsis were continued. As part of her liver transplant evaluation, extensive serologic investigation ensued. Acute hepatitis A-E serologies, ANA, IgG4, smooth muscle antibody (Ab), LKM-1 Ab, ceruloplasmin, a-1 antitrypsin, mitochondrial M2 Ab, AFP, HIV, HSV and EBV PCRs, blood cultures, galactomannan, and cryptococcal antigen were submitted and later found to be negative. She was also found to be pANCA MPO positive and PR3 negative. Liver biopsy was performed which revealed multiple areas of necrotic hepatocytes (up to 35% of liver parenchyma) (Figures -) in zones 2 and 3 of the liver. This was associated with some bile extravasation and acute inflammation. No signs of bridging or confluent necrosis were seen. A trichrome stain outlined regions of immature deposition of collagen near necrotic areas. This stain also showed increased perivenular fibrosis around the central veins but no evidence of periportal fibrosis. The portal triads showed nominal chronic inflammation with small lymphocytes, rare large lymphocytes, and a few scattered neutrophils. There was no bile duct injury, paucity, or vasculitis. The hepatocytes did not demonstrate significant steatosis, but there was bile stasis in a few canalicular spaces and hepatocytes. Viral inclusions were not seen. An iron stain showed no accumulation of hemosiderin within the hepatocytes. PCR was negative for HSV, EBV, and CMV and positive for VZV. The necrosis also abutted portal triads seen in the specimens (). A Periodic acid-Schiff stain with diastase did not show cytoplasmic globules. Blood PCRs were positive with high levels of VZV and low levels of CMV. The CMV viremia was attributed to secondary reactivation due to her severely immunosuppressed state. VZV immune globulin was considered as therapy, but IVIG was administered instead due to her severe coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. Outpatient skin biopsy cultures later confirmed VZV; PCR was positive for VZV and negative for HSV.\nHer hospital stay was complicated by multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae hospital acquired pneumonia and bacteremia, respiratory failure requiring prolonged intubation, and multiple organ failure. VZV PCR copies decreased with treatment, but her severity of illness and active infection prevented liver transplantation. The patient's code status was eventually changed to “do not resuscitate” and she expired.\n\nWhat is the patient's Wells' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis?\n\nA 66-year-old Caucasian woman with past medical history of dermatomyositis, dysphagia, gastro-esophageal reflux, and hypertension presented to the emergency department (ED) with several days of mid-epigastric, constant, moderate intensity, nonradiating abdominal pain.

            "input": "A 43-year-old man received an ABO-compatible living donor kidney transplant donated from his father in July 2012 for treatment of end-stage renal disease. The panel-reactive antibody test of the recipient and crossmatch were negative with two mismatches of HLA-A and HLA-DQ. Neither the recipient nor donor had a history of CD. Serum antibodies to HIV, EBV, and CMV were negative before the operation. The recipient received induction therapy with a 14-day course of antilymphocyte globulin (Pressimum; Behringwerke AG, Marburg, Germany). The immunosuppressive therapy started 3 days prior to transplantation. The immunosuppressive regimen consisted of tacrolimus at 3.5 mg twice daily, mycophenolate mofetil beginning at 750 mg twice daily and tapered off during a 4-week period, prednisone beginning at 20 mg daily and tapered off during a 6-week period, and valganciclovir at 450 mg daily for 3 months post-transplantation. The prednisone was withdrawn in the second month after transplantation because of gastrointestinal bleeding. At 4 years post-transplantation, the serum globulin level was found to have gradually increased without any patient discomfort. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. The serum creatinine level was maintained at a normal level, fluctuating from 1.1 to 1.2 mg/dL, and the urine protein was negative. The white blood cell count was mildly elevated at 10,580 cells/mm3 (normal range, 4000–10,000 cells/mm3) with 61.5% neutrophils. Serum EBV and CMV immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies were positive, while serum HIV and HHV-8 antibodies were negative. The RNA qualification of EBV showed 4.6 × 104 copies/mL, and CMV-DNA was negative. The serum level of interleukin 6 (IL-6) was normal. B-mode ultrasonography and computed tomography showed multiple lymphadenectases, including the bilateral cervical, inguinal, and abdominal cavity lymph nodes. No visceral enlargement or bone marrow involvement was found. Furthermore, positron emission tomography showed no abnormal metabolic signals of organomegaly or extranodal masses. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a high serum free light chain κ/λ level and low κ/λ ratio. Serum protein electrophoresis also showed an elevated percentage of gamma globulin but did not identify the monoclonal gammopathy. Immunofixation electrophoresis showed M protein negativity ().\nThe patient underwent biopsy of the right inguinal lymph node in a local hospital. The pathologic examination revealed a follicular pattern with some hyperplastic germinal centers, most of which were small and similarly sized with a round or oval shape. Numerous mature plasma cells were seen in medullary cords (). Cohesive large cells were present mainly in sinuses, and monocytoid B-cell proliferation was scattered in the mantle zone of the follicles; these B cells exhibited features of immunoblasts or anaplastic large cells (). Focally, the architecture was entirely destroyed by sheets of large typical cells. The pathological diagnosis was reactive lymphoid tissue of proliferated lymph nodes and slightly increased plasma cells increased in the medulla of the lymph nodes. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining of CD3, CD5, CD43, CD38, CD138, CD21, CD23, CD20, CD79, BCL2, and Ki-67 (<10%) in the large cells, with negative staining of CK, CD10, CD56, cyclin D1, SOX11, and IgG4. EBV-encoded early RNAs were found in the plasma cells based on in situ hybridization, while CMV inclusion bodies were not observed.\nBecause of the persistently elevated immunoglobulin level and generalized lymph node enlargement, another celiac lymph node biopsy was performed. Pathological evaluation of the celiac lymph node showed that multiple lymphoid follicles had been infiltrated by a large number of mature plasma cells. A few small blood vessels showed hyaline degeneration with “onion skin” like changes. The germinal centers were atrophied, and the proliferation of the sleeve cells and concentric round arrangement were not obvious. The pathological diagnosis was the characteristic plasma cell subtype of CD. The plasma cells were positive for CD3, CD20, CD38, CD138, and Ki-67 (<10%) (). CD138 showed strong positive expression in the plasma cells labeled by polyclonal anti-immunoglobulin kappa light chains and lambda antibodies (). Immunostaining for EBV and CMV was negative. We thereafter adjusted the dosage of immunosuppressants, adding prednisolone at 10 mg once a day, slowly tapering the tacrolimus down from 3.5 mg twice daily to 0.5 mg twice daily, and maintaining the mycophenolate mofetil at 500 mg twice daily. Two months after adjustment of the immunosuppression agents, the elevated immunoglobulin level and enlarged lymph nodes were not ameliorated. Because of the patient’s economic conditions and risk of infection, he did not receive rituximab to treat the multicentric CD. Instead, he received a CHOP chemotherapy regimen consisting of monthly cyclophosphamide (750 g/m2, day 1), vincristine (1.4 g/m2, day 1), doxorubicin (50 g/m2, day 1), and prednisone (60 mg/m2, once daily) for four cycles. After four cycles of chemotherapy, the enlarged lymph nodes had significantly decreased in size (). At the third month of follow-up, the serum globulins had dropped to a normal level (). At the ninth month of follow-up, the size of the lymph nodes located in the abdomen, axilla, and groin had significantly decreased. No acute rejection occurred during the post-transplantation follow-up. The serum creatinine level was maintained within the normal range, fluctuating from 1.1 to 1.2 mg/dL.\n\nWhat is the patient's Wells' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis?\n\nA 43-year-old man received an ABO-compatible living donor kidney transplant donated from his father in July 2012 for treatment of end-stage renal disease.

Instead, he received a CHOP chemotherapy regimen consisting of monthly cyclophosphamide (750 g/m2, day 1), vincristine (1.4 g/m2, day 1), doxorubicin (50 g/m2, day 1), and prednisone (60 mg/m2, once daily) for four cycles. After four cycles of chemotherapy, the enlarged lymph nodes had significantly decreased in size (). At the third month of follow-up, the serum globulins had dropped to a normal level (). At the ninth month of follow-up, the size of the lymph nodes located in the abdomen, axilla, and groin had significantly decreased. No acute rejection occurred during the post-transplantation follow-up.

She had undergone an early Kasai portoenterostomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis in the early neonatal period. Her subsequent postoperative course was complicated by two episodes of cholangitis. By the age of two she had developed portal hypertension resulting in secondary thrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism. She had developed esophageal varices requiring annual sclerotherapy until the age of sixteen when she underwent variceal banding. Her vaccinations were up-to-date.\nGeneral findings on presentation at 11 weeks revealed icterus with scattered spider naevi. On abdominal inspection there was an upper abdominal scar from her prior surgery and on palpation the spleen was enlarged extending to below the level of the umbilicus; there was no evidence of ascites.\nAn ultrasound confirmed her estimated date of delivery. She was referred to the medical clinic at the hospital to provide a multidisciplinary team input to her care.\nAt sixteen weeks she developed an episode of cholangitis and she was treated with intravenous antibiotics for seven days. A liver ultrasound was performed. This revealed absence of intrahepatic dilatation with multiple periportal and peripancreatic varices and 14 cm splenomegaly. During the pregnancy her platelets remained low (29–55 × 109 L) and hemoglobin ranged from 8.8 to 10.5 g/dL. Her transaminases were marginally elevated (AST/ALT, 46/67) and coagulation parameters were normal. Significant concern remained about her thrombocytopenia and degree of hypersplenism.\nA multidisciplinary meeting was convened with hepatology, hepatobiliary surgery, and interventional radiology. Concerns for this patient included her significant splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, risk of recurrent cholangitis, potential for massive variceal hemorrhage, and potential for preterm delivery, either spontaneous or iatrogenic. Abdominal delivery would also be compromised by large venous anastomoses in the anterior abdominal wall. A plan for management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage was outlined. Further imaging of her portal vessels was recommended as this would inform the interventional radiologists as to which was the optimum surgical intervention should bleeding develop from intraabdominal varices. The option of a splenectomy in pregnancy was excluded as this was deemed likely to cause portal vein thrombosis and would compromise any future candidacy for liver transplantation. At twenty weeks she underwent MR venography of the portal vessels. Her spleen measured 23 cm, there was evidence of extensive splenic and esophageal varices, and no lienorenal shunt was identified.\nShe had bimonthly antenatal visits with her obstetrical and hepatology teams. Her anatomy scan was within normal limits with a well-grown fetus on the 31st centile. Due to the complexity of the case and the potential for preterm delivery she received two doses of betamethasone at twenty-six weeks of gestation to aid lung maturation.\nAt 26+3 she presented to the maternity hospital with vaginal bleeding, suprapubic pressure, and uterine contractions for 24 hours with increasing intensity and duration. The fundal height was consistent with 26 weeks of pregnancy and cardiotocography was reassuring. Sterile speculum examination confirmed that the cervix was 5 cm dilated and fully effaced and the amniotic membranes were bulging through the cervix. A bedside ultrasound scan confirmed a breech presentation. Her platelet count was 33 × 109/L. Following consultation with perioperative medicine, the hepatobiliary team, and neonatology the decision was made to perform an emergency caesarean section. It had been planned to perform her surgery in a general hospital; however, due to the acute nature of her presentation the caesarean section was undertaken in the obstetric facility, with hepatobiliary surgery and interventional radiology on standby in the general hospital. Pooled platelets were administered immediately prior to surgery. Magnesium sulphate was administered to provide fetal neuroprotection. The caesarean section was performed via a vertical subumbilical incision, with a lower segment transverse incision on the uterus. The vertical incision was utilized both to provide greater access to the abdominal cavity should bleeding occur, either from the uterus or the varices, and to avoid large venous collaterals running vertically in the abdominal wall. A live male baby was delivered by breech extraction and transferred to the pediatric team following delayed cord clamping of 45 seconds. Apgar's scores were 61, 65, and 710; the cord blood gases were pH 7.27 (arterial) 7.29 (venous). The infant weighed 890 grams. The remainder of the surgery was uneventful. Perioperatively she received a further pooled platelet transfusion with good hemostasis and no transfusion of packed red cells was required. Her baby was transferred to intensive care and initially required CPAP. He had an uncomplicated neonatal course. Histology of the placenta was unremarkable. The patient had an uneventful postpartum course. She was advised against further pregnancies in view of her significant risks and underwent insertion of a levonorgestrel coil at three months postpartum for contraceptive purposes and she is currently awaiting liver transplantation. Despite the premature gestational age, the infant had an essentially uneventful postnatal course.

His medical history showed that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia several times by a local physician, and was hospitalized five times and treated with intravenous antibiotics. Following each hospitalization and treatment his fever resolved, but cough persisted. His family history was not significant. He had a negative history of contact with active tuberculous and had not received the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.\nThe patient presented to our hospital upon referral for further evaluation of the underlying cause of recurrent pneumonia. Physical examination showed he was malnourished and pale; his weight was 8.2 kg (<5th percentile), height was 73 cm (<5th percentile), body temperature was 37°C, blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, and heart rate was 112 beats per min. There was no BCG scar. He was tachypneic at 56 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation was 89% on room air. His respiratory sounds were rough and anteroposterior diameter of the chest was increased. There was abdominal distention and mild hepatomegaly, without splenic enlargement. Musculoskeletal examination revealed moderate thoracic kyphosis. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: White blood cell count 22.000/μL with 26% lymphocytes and 74% polymorphonuclear leukocytes; hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL; platelet count 809.000/μL; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 65 mm/h (normal: <20 mm/h), C-reactive protein 31.5 mg/L (normal: <2.9 mg/L). Serum electrolytes, renal and hepatic function test results were normal. Chest X-ray showed atelectasis and consolidation in the upper lobe of the right lung, and perihilar and pericardial infiltration in the left lung.\nHe was hospitalized and empirical intravenous cefepime was commenced for the non-specific treatment of pneumonia. Immunologic examinations were performed to determine the underlying cause of recurrent pneumonia. Serum quantitative immunoglobulin levels, the absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and the CH50 level were in normal range. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test result was 100%. Investigation of bone marrow smear showed no abnormalities. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed multiple paratracheal, precarinal, and right hilar lymph nodes, and consolidation in the middle and inferior lobes of the right lung and the inferior lobe of the left lung. Additionally, there was a 2-cm thick retroperitoneal soft tissue mass destroying the T7-8 and L1-L2 vertebral bodies, and infiltrating the spinal cord, pushing the aorta anteriorly. The mass extended from the level of bifurcation of the aorta to the bottom of the diaphragm and contained punctuate calcification. In addition to these findings, spinal MRI showed signal intensity changes in compatible with spinal cord edema, and an abscess extending to the medial fibers of the right and left psoas muscle at the L1-L3 level. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) showed hepatomegaly and several calcifications in the liver, and widespread splenic calcifications. Tuberculin skin test (TST) was negative. Early morning gastric aspirate and urine were negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). We preliminarily diagnosed the patient with miliary TB and Pott's disease, and began administering antituberculous treatment consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide on day 11 of hospitalization.\nTru-Cut biopsy for Pott's abscess was performed on day 14 of hospitalization, and AFB analysis and mycobacterial culture of the biopsy specimen was positive, whereas PCRs of biopsy specimen were negative. Histopathological examination showed severe degeneration and necrosis of muscle fibers. Mycobacterial culture and PCR of gastric aspirate were also positive, and as such definitive diagnoses of miliary TB, tuberculous spondylitis, and tuberculous iliopsoas abscess were established. Screening of household contacts did not identify any cases of active TB.

The patient was discharged after 28 day of anti-TB treatment. After 2 months of treatment, the anti-TB medication regimen was reduced to rifampin and isoniazid. After the 11th month of anti-TB treatment, spinal MRI findings were normal, except for angulation at the T9 level. Furthermore, thoracic CT was completely normal, but abdominal USG showed that hepatosplenic calcifications persisted. The patient completed 12 months of anti-TB therapy without any adverse effect. At the end of the anti-TB therapy all of the patient's symptoms were relieved and he was well except for kyphosis. The patient's family declined surgery to correct his kyphosis. Six years after completion of treatment, he had thoracic kyphosis, his height was under the 3 percentile. His throracic kyphosis deformity at 9 years old is demonstrated in . Control MRI in sagittal T2-weighted images revealed kyphosis at the level of T 7-8 vertebra due to the collapsed vertebral body. The signal intensity is normal as it is in chronic stage. The L1-3 vertebrae are also collapsed. No soft tissue mass consistent with abscess is observed. The signal intensity of the spinal cord is normal [].\n\nWhat is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?\n\nA 20-month-old male presented with a 1-year history of persistent fever, cough, and progressive abdominal distention. His medical history showed that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia several times by a local physician, and was hospitalized five times and treated with intravenous antibiotics. Following each hospitalization and treatment his fever resolved, but cough persisted. His family history was not significant. He had a negative history of contact with active tuberculous and had not received the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.\nThe patient presented to our hospital upon referral for further evaluation of the underlying cause of recurrent pneumonia. Physical examination showed he was malnourished and pale; his weight was 8.2 kg (<5th percentile), height was 73 cm (<5th percentile), body temperature was 37°C, blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, and heart rate was 112 beats per min. There was no BCG scar. He was tachypneic at 56 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation was 89% on room air. His respiratory sounds were rough and anteroposterior diameter of the chest was increased. There was abdominal distention and mild hepatomegaly, without splenic enlargement. Musculoskeletal examination revealed moderate thoracic kyphosis. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: White blood cell count 22.000/μL with 26% lymphocytes and 74% polymorphonuclear leukocytes; hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL; platelet count 809.000/μL; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 65 mm/h (normal: <20 mm/h), C-reactive protein 31.5 mg/L (normal: <2.9 mg/L). Serum electrolytes, renal and hepatic function test results were normal. Chest X-ray showed atelectasis and consolidation in the upper lobe of the right lung, and perihilar and pericardial infiltration in the left lung.\nHe was hospitalized and empirical intravenous cefepime was commenced for the non-specific treatment of pneumonia. Immunologic examinations were performed to determine the underlying cause of recurrent pneumonia. Serum quantitative immunoglobulin levels, the absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and the CH50 level were in normal range. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test result was 100%. Investigation of bone marrow smear showed no abnormalities. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed multiple paratracheal, precarinal, and right hilar lymph nodes, and consolidation in the middle and inferior lobes of the right lung and the inferior lobe of the left lung. Additionally, there was a 2-cm thick retroperitoneal soft tissue mass destroying the T7-8 and L1-L2 vertebral bodies, and infiltrating the spinal cord, pushing the aorta anteriorly. The mass extended from the level of bifurcation of the aorta to the bottom of the diaphragm and contained punctuate calcification. In addition to these findings, spinal MRI showed signal intensity changes in compatible with spinal cord edema, and an abscess extending to the medial fibers of the right and left psoas muscle at the L1-L3 level. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) showed hepatomegaly and several calcifications in the liver, and widespread splenic calcifications. Tuberculin skin test (TST) was negative. Early morning gastric aspirate and urine were negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). We preliminarily diagnosed the patient with miliary TB and Pott's disease, and began administering antituberculous treatment consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide on day 11 of hospitalization.\nTru-Cut biopsy for Pott's abscess was performed on day 14 of hospitalization, and AFB analysis and mycobacterial culture of the biopsy specimen was positive, whereas PCRs of biopsy specimen were negative. Histopathological examination showed severe degeneration and necrosis of muscle fibers. Mycobacterial culture and PCR of gastric aspirate were also positive, and as such definitive diagnoses of miliary TB, tuberculous spondylitis, and tuberculous iliopsoas abscess were established. Screening of household contacts did not identify any cases of active TB. The patient's condition progressively improved; respiratory symptoms and findings resolved, and he began to gain weight during the following weeks. The patient was discharged after 28 day of anti-TB treatment. After 2 months of treatment, the anti-TB medication regimen was reduced to rifampin and isoniazid.

Chest pain and shortness of breath were increased in severity on exertion and were associated with palpitation, but there is no history of sweating, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, unconsciousness, and convulsion. There was no radiation of chest pain. Chest pain was suddenly increased for last five days and the patient was admitted in the emergency department with a suspicion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). There was no history of fever, hemoptysis, leg swelling, and facial puffiness. History of significant weight loss and anorexia were present. There was no history of household contact with the patient of sputum smear positive tuberculosis. The patient received formoterol + tiotropium metered dose inhaler (2 puffs once daily with spacer) and oral doxofylline (400 mg twice daily) for last five years, as he suffered from chronic bronchitis predominant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which resulted in persistent breathlessness, cough, and expectoration.\nGeneral survey revealed anemia and clubbing, but there was no cyanosis, edema, and engorged neck vein.

Examination of other system was normal. Complete hemogram showed anemia with hemoglobin concentration of 7.1 g/dL. Blood biochemistry was normal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atypical ST segment elevation and T wave inversion in lateral chest leads (Lead V4, Lead V5, and Lead V6).

An electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and secundum-type ASD (22.3 mm) with a left-to-right shunt was diagnosed by echocardiogram. Device closure (Amplatzer septal occlude 28 mm; AGA Medical, Golden Valley, MN, USA) was then performed; however, 1 week after the procedure, the patient continued to experience dyspnea and chest pain after 10 to 20 minutes of walking. Sustained atrial fibrillation was seen on the electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. Cardioversion was performed following hospitalization with the opinion that the persistent atrial fibrillation was due to device closure. The patient was discharged from the hospital after cardioversion to sinus rhythm at 100 J; however, the symptoms recurred. Since it was difficult to perform radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) due to the recent device closure, the patient was referred to the thoracic surgery department for totally thoracoscopic ablation. Surgery was performed under routine procedures. Intubation was performed using a double lumen endotracheal tube. For the surgery, a 10-mm trocar was inserted in the fourth intercostal space (ICS) of the right anterior axillary line, a 5-mm trocar in the third ICS along the anterior axillary line, and a 10-mm trocar in the sixth ICS on the mid-axillary line. Right pulmonary vein ablation, right ganglionated plexi ablation, and ablation of the right half of the space between the right lower pulmonary vein and the left lower pulmonary vein were performed. Between the procedures, we conducted a high-frequency stimulation test for finding ganglionated plexi. Sutures were placed after chest tube insertion.

The virus RNA in stool, urine, vaginal discharge and breast milk were all negative despite the repeated testing. The chest CT indicated viral pneumonia. The patient’s father tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on repeated tests.\nAfter admission, the patient was treated with 1.5 million units of recombinant human interferon α-2b by aerosolization, twice daily, during a course of 7 days, and also received other symptomatic treatment. On the second day of admission, the patient’s body temperature returned to normal. The patient continued to have occasional dry cough, but the runny nose and appetite improved. The symptoms were completely relieved on February 8, with the disappearance of fever, cough and runny nose.\nThe test results for SARS-CoV-2 after admission: On February 5 (at 6 days after symptom onset), the virus RNA in urine was negative. On February 6, 7, 10, 14 and 25 (at 7, 8, 11, 15 and 26 days after symptom onset), the virus RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs were positive. During the same period, virus RNA was also found to be positive in stool. On February 27 and 29 (at 28 and 30 days after symptom onset), the virus RNA tests were repeatedly negative in both the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool. The reevaluation of the chest CT on February 28 also revealed the resorption of ground glass opacities that were previously observed in the right lower lobe (Fig. b, d). The patient was discharged on February 29.\n\nCalculate Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis by summing the results of the following rules:\n    Age: 3-14 years = +1 point, 15-44 years = 0 points, ≥45 years = -1 point\n    Exudate or swelling on tonsils: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Temperature >38°C (100.4°F): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n    Cough: Cough present = 0 points, Cough absent = +1 point",

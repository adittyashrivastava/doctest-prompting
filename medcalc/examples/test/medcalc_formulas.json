            "input": "A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().\nThe patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 130/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 72 beats/minute (bpm); respiratory rate, 20/minute; and body temperature, 36.4°C. She appeared chronically ill and the findings of a physical examination of the thorax, heart, and abdomen were unremarkable. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8,110/μL (neutrophils, 78.5%; and lymphocytes, 17.5%) and a hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.5 g/dL. Serum biochemical values were as follows: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 12 mg/dL; serum creatinine (Cr), 0.8 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase, 21/14 U/L; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; total bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dL; and amylase 2,460 U/L. Electrolyte levels were as follows: Na, 139 mmol/L; K, 4.0 mmol/L; and Cl, 102 mmol/L. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels were 37.0 U/mL.\nAn abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 2-cm mass near the ampulla of Vater with mild dilation of the intrahepatic and common bile ducts as well as the pancreatic ducts (). There was no evidence of invasion of other organs. Both kidneys were normal sized without apparent abnormalities.\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a 2-cm adenoma-like protruding lesion in the ampulla of Vater. EUS showed a well-defined isoechoic homogeneous mass without bile or pancreatic duct invasion (-). The mass was resected using a snare and a plastic stent was inserted into the bile duct; insertion of a plastic stent into the pancreatic duct failed. No specific complications, including severe bleeding or perforation, were observed (). Six hours post-procedure, the patient vomited 50 mL of blood and complained of abdominal pain. A second episode of hematemesis (<30 cc) occurred approximately 5 hours later. Immediately after the second episode, treatment with 1 g of tranexamic acid and 2 KU of hemocoagulase administered three times per day along with ceftriaxone (2 g intravenous) and a proton pump inhibitor for suspected bleeding at the resection site was initiated. Her vital signs were unremarkable. The WBC count was 7,090/μL, Hb was 10.1 g/dL, BUN was 14 mg/dL, Cr was 0.8 mg/dL, and amylase/lipase was 69/54 U/L. After the initial two episodes of hematemesis, no further hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia was observed and the patient’s vital signs remained stable. Her Hb level remained >10 g/dL. Four days after the papillectomy, the patient’s daily urine volume abruptly decreased to <100 cc and she complained of dyspnea. Her blood pressure was 103/86 mm Hg, heart rate was 134 bpm, respiratory rate was 30/minute, and body temperature was 37.0°C. Laboratory studies were as follows: Hb, 9.1 g/dL; amylase/lipase, 415/418 U/L; BUN/Cr, 73/3.9 mg/dL; and brain natriuretic peptide, 5,000 pg/mL. Venous blood gas analysis revealed the following: pH, 6.92: pCO2, 37 mm Hg; and HCO3, 7.6 mmol/L. Pulmonary edema was observed on a chest radiograph and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was performed to treat metabolic acidosis and pulmonary edema caused by acute renal failure. Although there were no signs of bleeding at that time, 2 units of packed red blood cells were transfused.\nApproximately 10 hours after the CRRT was initiated, the patient was noted to have melena mixed with a small amount of hematochezia. Melena continued to occur 2–3 times/day with a total daily volume of 200–400 cc. Her vital signs were relatively stable: blood pressure, 120–175/65–100 mm Hg; heart rate, 90–120 bpm; respiratory rate, 20–25/minute; and body temperature, 36.0°C–37.8°C. The daily serum Hb level was 7.1–9.5 g/dL and the tranexamic acid with hemocoagulase were continued. The patient received a total of 13.5 g of tranexamic acid and 36 KU of hemocoagulase and received three additional units of packed red blood cells until the sixth day post-procedure, when no further signs of bleeding were observed. However, her daily urine output was nearly zero despite the CRRT. A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan was performed on day 12 to assess the cause of her anuric acute renal failure and showed normal-sized kidneys with enhancement of the renal medulla but not of the renal cortex, a finding consistent with acute RCN (). Histopathology revealed a villotubular high-grade adenoma with clear resection margins. Conventional hemodialysis was continued, but renal function did not improve and the oliguria persisted post-discharge. Presently, 6 months after the endoscopic procedure, she continues to undergo hemodialysis. Her most recent BUN/Cr was 22/6.1 mg/dL.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Anion Gap: albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL))",

She was hospitalized with a diagnosis of lower right leg cellulitis, and we began cefazolin administration at 3 g/day. On admission, her diabetic control was poor (HbA1c, 11.5%, postprandial blood glucose, 268 mg/dL); in addition, her body temperature was 39.2°C, pulse rate 106 beats/min, blood pressure 137/71 mmHg, height 166 cm, and body weight 61 kg. Routine laboratory testing showed an elevated leukocyte count of 13.8 × 103 cells/μL and a C-reactive protein level of 4.49 mg/dL. Serological tests for syphilis and HIV were negative. Soon after starting antibiotic treatment, her fever subsided. Five days later, redness and swelling disappeared; therefore, we changed treatment to cefdinir at 900 mg/day.

He had a significant weight loss up to 8 kg within one month, but had no fever or jaundice. There is a history of eating habits: eating uncooked fish, meat, and beef. He also had polyuria upon admission. On physical examination, it was found that he was cachexic. His weight was in the 3rd percentile. Generalized lymphadenopathy and marked hepatosplenomegaly were detected. Neurological examination was within the normal limit.\nHis laboratory data revealed that the hemoglobin level was 13.3 g/dl, the hematocrit value was 41.5 volume %, the WBC count was 15,100 cells/mm3 (neutrophil 60%, lymphocyte 30%, monocyte 9%, and basophil 1%), and the platelets count was 304,000 cells/mm3. Peripheral blood smears were normochromic and normocytic red blood cells, without blasts cells. Bone marrow examination and biopsy were normal. The chromosome study reviewed 46 XY, normal male karyotype. The liver function test revealed that the level of albumin was 4.9 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.3 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dl, SGOT 73 U/L, SGPT 46 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 339 U/L. Uric acid level was 6.1 mg/dl. The amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 149 U/L. Serum electrolytes showed that the level of sodium was 134 mmol/l, potassium 3.82 mmol/l, chloride 98.5 mmol/l, and bicarbonate 26.3 mmol/l. Hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia were detected; the serum calcium level had increased to 13.6 mg/dl and the phosphate level to 2.3 mg/dl. The blood urea nitrogen level was 11.7 mg/dl and creatinine 0.5 mg/dl. Serum amylase was 37 U/L, and serum lipase was higher than normal of 96 U/L. The amount of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) was 630 (normal range 15–85) U/L. Stool examination revealed blastocystis hominis. Chest X-ray showed generalized osteopenia (). The bone scan showed no evidence of active bone lesion.\nCT chest and whole abdomen (Figures and ) revealed hepatomegaly and numerous heterogeneous low-attenuation centers varying in size, with peripheral rim-enhancing masses scattered in both hepatic lobes, and the largest one was 8 × 7.5 × 11.6 cm in size. No dilatation of intrahepatic duct and CBD was seen. The spleen was enlarged, and the hypodensity mass size was 1.4 × 1.9 cm. The pancreas was enlarged with an ill-defined irregular hypodensity mass at the pancreatic body, and the tail size was 2.2 × 4.7 × 2.8 cm. Enlarged portal and para-aortic nodes were observed.\nInvestigations for hypercalcemia were performed. The intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level was very low 6.33 (normal range 15–65) pg/ml, while the 25-OH vitamin D level was 27 (normal range 30–100) ng/ml. It was shown that secondary hypercalcemia developed due to malignancy that is most likely from the parathyroid hormone- (PTH-) related protein (PTHrP) producing tumor.\nThe level of serum tumor markers such as alpha fetoprotein was 78.52 ng/ml, CA 19-9 was 360.8 U/ml, and CA 125 was 267.10 U/ml while the CEA and β-hCG were normal.\nLiver biopsy was performed for diagnosis.

His past history was remarkable for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), secondary polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, and old pulmonary tuberculosis. He was maintained on salbutamol inhaler, fluticasone, and salmetrol discus inhaler, theophylline and home oxygen therapy. He denied receiving systemic corticosteroids in the preceding year. He was an ex-smoker and alcohol drinker. Physical examination on admission revealed an ill looking, dyspneic patient with a temperature 38.4°C, blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg, pulse rate 160/minute, and respiratory rate 36/minute. Chest examination revealed expiratory wheezes and bilateral basal crepitations. Otherwise, physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations revealed hemoglobin 13 mg/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) 14.6×109 /L (neutrophils 82%, lymphocytes 10%), platelets 25×109 /L, glucose 11.4 mmol/L, creatinine 135 mmol/L, sodium 129 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L. Arterial blood gases revealed pH 7.19, PCO2 74.8 mm Hg, PO2 96 mm Hg. Chest radiograph showed no lung infiltrates. Sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sensitive to cefipime and ciprofloxacin; however, it was thought to represent colonization. A diagnosis of COPD with acute exacerbation was made, for which he was given intravenous ceftriaxone 2 gm once daily, azithromycin 500 mg once daily, methylprednisolone 40 mg three times daily, and salbutamol and ipratropium bromide nebulizers. He made a gradual improvement, and after seven days he was shifted to oral prednisolone 40 mg once daily and oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to complete two weeks of antibiotics. Prednisolone was given for a total of 13 days. Three weeks after admission he developed hemoptysis, chest tightness, and worsening cough. Sputum culture grew P aeruginosa for which he was given intravenous cefepime and ciprofloxacin. Sputum smear for acid fast bacilli (AFB) was negative. Because of worsening respiratory status and a chest radiograph showing an infiltrate involving the whole left lung and part of the right lung, bronchoscopy was performed on 27 January 2005. No endobronchial lesion was found. Antituberculous drugs in the form of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were started. Bronchioalveolar lavage and bronchial wash were negative for AFB but bacterial culture grew P aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebisella pneumoniae. Cytologic examination of the bronchial wash and lavage revealed bronchial epithelial cells, few squamous cells in the background of numerous S stercoralis worms () and bacteria with inflammatory cells and blood. Transbronchial biopsy showed only intraalveolar hemorrhage with anthracotic pigments, but was negative for granuloma, viral inclusions, or malignancy. He was treated with oral ivermectin 12mg once daily. Two days later he complained of vomiting, lower abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and constipation. Physical examination revealed abdominal distention, lower abdominal tenderness, and sluggish bowel sounds. A plain radiograph of the abdomen revealed distended bowel loops but no air fluid levels. Lapratomy was done. The findings at surgery were a dilated jejunum and ileum filled with stool. Microscopic examination of the resected part of the ileum bowel revealed acute inflammation, mucosal hemorrhage, and focal ulceration with abundant S stercoralis larvae (Figures and ). Postoperatively, he was mechanically ventilated.

He had a history of binocular diplopia, increased stool frequency 7 years prior to admission, and weight loss of 10 kg. He also had thyroid nodules, and thyroid functional tests showed normal FT3 (7.41, normal 3.6–7.5 pmol/L), FT4 (21.56, normal 12–22 pmol/L), and increased TSH (24.79, normal 0.27–4.2 μIU/mL). He ignored the test result, because of the normal concentration of FT3 and FT4. Four years ago the patient got married and was referred to our hospital because of sterility. At this time, the hormonal examination implied central hypogonadism with serum levels of 1.6 mIU/mL FSH (RR, 1.5–12.4), LH 1.0 mIU/mL (RR, 1.7–8.6), E2 <5 pg/mL (RR, 7.63–42.8), and T <0.03 ng/mL (RR 2.49–8.3). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sella region was therefore performed, revealing a pituitary tumor measuring 4.3 × 4.1 × 3.0 cm in the sella, involving cavernous sinuses and extending inferior to the sphenoid sinus and third ventricle (Fig. ). He was referred to our multidisciplinary team of pituitary disease and transferred to department of neurosurgery. On physical examination at admission, the patient was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 59.0 kg with a body mass index (BMI) of 20.9 kg/m2. The patient's char-acteristics were as follows: temperature, 36.2 °C; pulse, 56 beat/min; blood pressure, 94/64 mmHg; respiratory rate, 20 breath/min. The patient presented with blurred vision. The TgAb and TPOAb were positive. The thyroid gland was diffusely enlarged and ultrasonography of the thyroid revealed a multinodular gland with a moderate parenchymal heterogeneity suggesting Hashimoto thyroiditis. The laboratory hormone examination showed hypopituitarism (Table ). The computer perimetry suggested a defective visual field. Based on these data, we diagnosed the patient with TSH-producing pituitary macroadenoma, hypopituitary, and Hashimoto thyroiditis. Two weeks after diagnosis, total resection of the pituitary macroadenoma was performed through trans-sphenoidal neurosurgery in September 2014. Upon immunohistochemical examination, the resected pituitary adenoma cells exhibited positive staining with the TSH and PRL antibody, and the percentage of positive Ki-67 was <2%, suggesting that the tumor was benign (Fig. ). After the operation, TSH and thyroid hormone rapidly decreased to a normal range. However, the concentration of ACTH, cortisol, LH, FSH, and testosterone were still extremely low. One year after the operation, this patient was attended to by our pituitary disease MDT team for reproductive reconstruction. We treated him with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) 2000 IU, qod and human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) 75 IU, qod. Over the next 2 months, his sperm concentration increased, and finally his wife became pregnant naturally.

Risk factors were arterial hypertension and cigarette smoking. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) with hyponatremia was noticed and tumour search detected metastatic liver disease and enlarged hilar lymph nodes. Blood analysis revealed elevated levels for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin-fragment (Cyfra), and liver biopsy specified metastases of a small cellular, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumour (NET). Further staging via FDG PET disclosed the primary tumour near the left lung hilus with positive mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, diffuse osseous filiarisation, and a sole metastasis in the right adrenal gland. Oncology board consensus decision was made for palliative chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposid (80 mg/sqm, 120 mg/sqm, resp.) as common for dedifferentiated NET.\nTwo weeks after the initial bout of chemotherapy the patient presented in the Surgical Department with incomplete ischemia of the left lower limb. Immediate interventional recanalization failed and open embolectomy of the tibiofibular trunk with consecutive venous patch plasty was performed. Histological examination of the embolus showed no malignancy. Three days later reischemia of the same leg occurred and the operative procedure was repeated. Search for embolic origin by CT-scan disclosed clinically inapparent pulmonary embolism in three lobes. Mural thrombus of the infrarenal aorta with perifocal aortic wall calcifications appeared identical to the initial staging CT (). All tumour manifestations showed downsizing in response to the previous systemic chemotherapy. High doses of unfractioned heparins (up to 40.000 IE/d) were administered for anticoagulation. Aspirin was given for platelet inhibition. Activated partial thromboplastin time presented sufficiently prolonged with normal levels of antithrombin III when symptoms began.\nAgain four days later, transfemoral and pedal embolectomy with multilocular patch plasties of all native crural arteries as ultima ratio due to complete ischemia had to be performed. Decision was made for major amputation as symptoms recurred again two days later. After clinical signs of ischemia of the contralateral limb and respiratory impairment, all parties agreed upon the best supportive care concept.

His mother’s second pregnancy was a male with agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC), congenital heart disease and absence of nasal bone which were detected on ultrasound at 24th week. The pregnancy had been terminated without genetic tests or autopsy. The patient’s antenatal ultrasonographic investigation showed an IACC at 18 weeks of gestation but fetal MRI was not performed and amniocentesis revealed 46, XY karyotype. He had not defecated for the first three days of life; he defecated a large amount of stool after rectal stimulation. The patient underwent laparotomy for intestinal biopsies and diagnosed with HSCR and ileostomy was opened.\nHe presented to our clinic when he was one year old with fever for two days. His weight was 8.4 kg (3 rd percentile); height 74 cm (3 rd percentile); and head circumference 46 cm (25th percentile). Hypertelorism, uplifted earlobes with a central depression, frontal bossing, telecanthus, deeply set eyes, infraorbital fold, long lashes, broad eyebrows with a medial flare, a wide nasal bridge with prominent and rounded nasal tip, low-hanging columella, open-mouth expression, thin “M” shaped upper lip, prominent chin, short neck, wide-spaced nipples, overlapping toes, and pes planus were noted (\n–). Abdominal examination showed no guarding or rebound tenderness; he had orange-colored liquid stool in an ileostomy bag. He had eye contact, social smile, and stereotypic hand movements, speaking indistinguishable three words. Traction response was poor, and he was hypotonic on vertical suspension. He could not sit unassisted. Deep tendon reflexes were normal; bilaterally plantar reflexes were extensor; sustained Achilles clonus was noted. At admission, urinalysis showed pyuria. Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed. Urinary ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram showed grade 3 hydronephrosis affecting the right ureter. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles, the occipital and temporal horns. There was a bilateral incomplete hippocampal inversion, enlargement of thalamus, nucleus caudate, and ACC (\n–). A heterozygous “class 2” c.646dupT (p.Cys216LeufsTer23) mutation on exon 6 of ZEB2 (zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2) gene was detected by a mutation surveyor program, and the diagnosis of MWS was made. At 16 months, he presented with fever due to pneumonia and generalized seizure for 5 minutes. His EEG showed no epileptic discharge but an immature parietooccipital rhythm for his age.

Her symptoms were associated with chills, nausea, and just one episode of emesis. Over the preceding 4 days, the patient had developed a Bartholin's gland cyst infection with abscess formation. She admitted to abstaining from any solid food intake in the previous 2 days; however, she maintained her liquid intake and continued taking her insulin glargine without insulin aspart. She denied any alcohol intake or drug abuse. Her vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination was significant for diffuse abdominal tenderness without rigidity or guarding and a ruptured Bartholin's gland abscess with drainage to the skin. Blood work showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13,000 cells/mcL (normal range: 4,500-10,000/mcL), hemoglobin level 11.2 mg/dL (normal range: 12.3-15.3 g/dL), platelet count 448,000/mcL (normal range: 150,000-450,000/mcL), sodium 135 mmol/L (normal range: 136-145 mmol/L), potassium 3.6 mmol/L (normal range: 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), chloride 105 mmol/L (normal range: 98-107 mmol/L), carbon dioxide 6 mmol/L (normal range: 21-32 mmol/L), anion gap 24 mmol/L (normal range: 3-11 mmol/L), urea nitrogen 4 mg/dL (normal range: 7-18 mg/dL), creatinine 0.58 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6-1.3 mg/dL), glucose 191 mg/dL (normal range: 70-100 mg/dL), beta hydroxybutyrate >4.5 mg/dL (normal range: <0.4 mg/dL), magnesium 1.3 mg/dL (normal range: 1.6-2.3 mg/dL), phosphorus 1.3 mg/dL (normal range: 2.5-4.9 mg/dL), lactate 0.8 mmol/L (normal range: 0.4-2 mmol/L), and HBA1C 12.5% (normal range: 4-5.6%). Urinalysis was significant for +3 ketones and sugar. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.07, pCO2 12. A urine drug screen was negative, and serum ethanol level was undetectable.\nThe patient was diagnosed with euglycemic DKA precipitated by an underlying infection. Intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation with normal saline was initially started at a rate of 1.0 L/h for a total of 2 L. The patient's hydration status, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, and urine output were monitored closely. After 2 h, repeat blood work showed a serum sodium 141 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 8 mmol/L, potassium 3.5 mmol/L, and glucose 153 mg/dL. Subsequently, IVFs were switched to 5% dextrose and 0.45% NaCl at a rate of 250 cc/h, and an insulin drip at a rate of 5 units/h was started. Then, 30 mEq potassium was added to each liter of the IVF, excluding the first liter, targeting a serum potassium level of 4-5 mEq/L. After 11 h, blood work revealed a serum bicarbonate level of 16 mmol/L with a normal anion gap; hence, subcutaneous insulin and oral intake were initiated.

The patient reported early satiety, a 30 lb. weight loss over 3 weeks and was unable to tolerate anything by mouth. Additionally, the patient had developed a left lateral neck mass which progressively increased in size over the past 9 months. Patient denied tenderness to palpation of the mass and dysphagia. His past medical history was significant for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, GERD, chronic hepatitis C, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). His past surgical history was remarkable for thyroid malignancy treatment with radioactive iodine and total thyroidectomy in addition to a gunshot wound. Family and social history were not significant. On physical exam, a left supraclavicular soft tissue mass 6 cm in diameter was appreciated, it was non-tender with no submandibular lymphadenopathy. A soft tissue mass was also palpable on the anterior abdominal wall in the epigastric region.\nGiven the patient's malignant history, significant weight loss in the past 3 weeks with increasing left mass size, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, the patient was admitted for further evaluation. Initial studies included ultrasound of the abdomen for workup of acute pancreatitis with findings unremarkable for the body of the pancreas and the head and tail not being visualized. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed pulmonary nodules in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe of the lung and bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe, PKD and bilateral hepatic cysts. Oncology was consulted, and a CT of the chest and neck were ordered in addition to a chest X-ray that was remarkable for two pulmonary nodules with an enlarged paratracheal node. Pulmonology was consulted, and the patient was recommended to follow-up in 6 months for surveillance of the pulmonary nodules. ENT and Surgery were consulted, and an excisional lymph node biopsy was pursued due to suspicion of possible recurrence of previous thyroid malignancy or metastases (). Histopathology revealed metastatic mucin-producing adenocarcinoma. Immunoperoxidase studies performed on paraffin sections revealed the neoplastic cells were positive for CK20 and CDX2. The cells were negative for CK7, TTF-1, p63, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase (PACP), chromogranin, synaptophysin and S-100. Gastroenterology was consulted, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed including an antral biopsy of the gastric mucosa, which was unremarkable. Colonoscopy of the lower GI tract revealed a 6 cm obstructing mass in the transverse colon and a biopsy was taken revealing findings of invasive well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous features, focally present in subserosal tissue with ten of eleven regional lymph nodes involved. This confirmed the primary cancer originated from the colonic mass and metastasized to the left lateral neck mass (Virchow’s node).\nSurgical intervention was pursued with resection of the transverse colon with primary end-to-end anastomosis. This resolved the intractable acute abdomen. The patient was offered a trial of chemotherapy; however, given the patient’s diagnosis of metastatic colonic carcinoma, further treatment options were not pursued.

He was receiving treatment with dexamethasone 100 μg and Levothyroxine sodium 1 mg per day. One month before admission, he experienced a fall, which resulted in difficulty in walking. At the first visit to the physician, because he could not describe any symptoms, only knee radiography was performed and there were no abnormalities. The pain in his right leg progressively worsened and he presented to our outpatient clinic after one month.\nOn physical examination, the patient was slightly obese with a height of 161 cm and weight of 63 kg noted. His right leg was externally rotated, and he hesitated to stand up. The passive range of motion of the right hip was limited, especially in adduction and internal rotation (right/left; flexion 90°/120°, extension 10°/10°, abduction 45°/45°, adduction 0°/30°, external rotation 60°/45°, and internal rotation 10°/30°). Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 levels were low, but free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were almost normal. The radiographs of the hip joints showed a right atypical slippage of the epiphysis (). Both neck shaft angles were large (right/left; 160°/155°) and lateral tilts of the physis were normal on intact side (right/left; 35° lateral/13° medial). Three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) images showed lateral epiphyseal displacement on the right femoral head (Figures and ), indicating valgus SCFE.\nThe patient underwent in situ pinning of the hip on both sides. On the right side, the procedure was performed through a limited 5 cm longitudinal incision, positioned medially on the thigh (frog position), posterior to the femoral neurovascular bundle. A single φ5.5 mm partially threaded cannulated screw (Meira, Japan) was placed across the physis. In situ pinning on the left side was performed as a prophylactic pinning because of endocrine abnormalities (). Postoperatively, we had difficulty in limiting weight bearing due to communication difficulties.\nOne month after surgery, he could walk better than before the operation. At the 1-year follow-up, he could walk without difficulty and there were no signs of pain. The passive range of motion of the right hip joint was slightly improved in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (100°, 20°, and 20°, resp.).

An inferior vena cava filter was subsequently inserted. A colonoscopy\nrevealed a 15-mm polyp in the cecum and nonbleeding hemorrhoids. Her hemoglobin\nlevel subsequently stabilized following blood transfusions. She continued to improve\nclinically on the current antibiotic regimen. Ultimately, she was discharged to\ncomplete a 6-week course of antibiotics through a peripherally inserted central\ncatheter line to follow-up outpatient with nephrology, infectious disease, and\nprimary care physician.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta ratio?\n\nDelta Ratio: delta_ratio = delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

            "input": "A 34-year-old Surinamese female was referred to the Department of Vascular Medicine of our hospital because of right-sided blurred vision, caused by ischemic retinopathy and neovascularisation (Fig. ). Her medical history was remarkable for heterozygote alpha-thalassemia, but negative for thrombotic and recurrent infectious events. The family history was also negative for thrombotic events or bleeding tendency. The patient was not treated with anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors. Physical examination was normal (BMI 23.0 kg/m2, blood pressure 125/70 mmHg, heart rate 85/min, normal heart sounds, and no vascular murmurs). After the exclusion of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, hyperviscosity, and sickle cell disease, a thrombophilia workup was performed. All hemostatic laboratory parameters were found normal except for an increased protein S activity (179%) with high free protein S level (207%), despite a normal total protein S antigen level (98%) (Table ). This suggested that, in contrast to normal conditions, all protein S was free protein S, instead of 30–40% free and 60–70% bound protein S. High activity and antigen levels of free protein S were confirmed in a separate sample 3 months later. Clinically, a protein S deficiency is considered as a possible cause of hypercoagulation, which in turn could have led to the retinopathy. The incidental finding of elevated protein S levels were not considered explanatory of the condition. We did not initiate anticoagulation or thrombocyte aggregation inhibition. The patient's vision did not improve remarkably, nor did it deteriorate in the subsequent months after her initial visit.\nThe high free protein S level in the proband was caused by a reduced level of C4BP (18%), as measured with an ELISA against the α-chain of C4BP. To identify a possible molecular defect underlying the C4BP deficiency, we sequenced the protein-coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of C4BPA (encoding C4BPα, ) and C4BPB (encoding C4BPβ, ).\nWe identified two previously reported non-synonymous variants in C4BPA, that is, c.719G>A (p.R240H), rs45574833 ((A=0.0140/1686 (ExAC), A = 0.0030/15 (1000 Genomes), A = 0.0095/124 (GO-ESP), A = 0.0078/227 (TOPMED)), and c.899T>C (p.I300T), rs4844573 (C = 0.4014/47780 [ExAC], C = 0.4898/2453 [1000 Genomes], C = 0.4841/6296 [GO-ESP], T = 0.4689/13653 [TOPMED]).\nIn addition, we screened the father and brother for these mutations. Both are also Surinamese. Only p.I300T was present in the father (Fig. ). Both father and brother had normal free protein S levels. Mother, second sister, and second brother were unavailable for testing.\nDiscordant data concerning the association between C4BP polymorphisms and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported , . Furthermore, these two variants have also been identified in women experiencing recurrent miscarriages, but due to equally high frequencies between patients and controls, the importance of these variants in this particular clinical situation may be questionable . No mutations were found in the C4BPB gene.\nBecause we could not find clear molecular defect in the C4BP gene responsible for the reduced expression, and a recent report indicated that binding of protein S to C4BP promotes cellular secretion of C4BP , we also sequenced the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-like region of protein S (), responsible for binding to C4BP using the previously published primers , . No mutations explaining a reduced binding of protein S to C4BP were found in the SHBG-domain of protein S.\nAlthough the medical records did not report any use of vitamin K antagonist, we excluded the interference of any form of vitamin K antagonists by the measurement of coagulation factors II, VII, and X which were all normal, except for factor X which was slightly increased (163%) (Table ). Furthermore, there was no indication of reduced capacity of liver synthesis with normal antithrombin and factor V levels. Furthermore, we also did not find a clear effect of decreased C4BP levels on the complement route, with normal complement pathway activities (Table ).\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?\n\nMean Arterial Pressure (MAP): MAP = 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure)",

            "input": "A 75-year-old man with a slightly increased serum creatinine level had developed proteinuria and hypertension in 2000. In 2007, he noticed a gradually progressive hearing loss and repeated bloody nasal discharge resulting from a refractory sinusitis. He was admitted to our hospital for evaluation in June 2008.\nInitial laboratory findings revealed elevated serine proteinase 3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA; 26.2 EU), blood urea nitrogen (35 mg/dl), and serum creatinine (1.62 mg/dl) levels. Urinalysis indicated proteinuria (0.2 g/day) without hematuria. A head CT revealed maxillary sinusitis. Tissue from a nasal mucosal biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation in the extravascular area. Because of these combined findings, he was diagnosed as having granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for GPA and Watts’ algorithm [, ]. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score 2003 was 6. Because of the low disease activity, the slow progression and the advanced age, we did not initiate immunosuppressive therapy at this time.\nIn October 2008, he developed fever lasting for several days. Laboratory data were as follows: C-reactive protein 11.91 mg/dl, PR3-ANCA 49.1 U/ml, fibrinogen 752 mg/dl, D-dimer 1.7 µg/ml, and urinary protein 0.27 g/day. Activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and fibrin degradation product were within the respective normal range. A chest CT was normal. Although we administered meropenem (2.0 g/day for 1 week), vancomycin (500 mg/day for 17 days) and itraconazole (200 mg/day for 20 days), the fever and C-reactive protein level did not decrease. On day 12 of admission, he showed mild disorientation, severe hearing loss and hoarseness. A brain MRI revealed a mass lesion in the right frontal lobe and hypertrophic mucosa in the paranasal sinuses (fig. ) in addition to a thickened and strongly enhanced dura mater surrounding the mass lesion (fig. ). He was diagnosed as having GPA with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score had increased to 21. We treated him with methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 3 days. However, he rapidly developed left hemiparesis and deterioration of consciousness [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): E1V2M4]. A brain CT revealed that the parenchymal mass lesion had enlarged and the mucous effusion was invading the posterior wall of the right frontal sinus. Due to an impending transtentorial herniation, a decompressive hemicraniectomy and partial right frontal lobectomy were performed, which moderately improved his consciousness (GCS: E2V3M4). After the surgery, he developed bloody sputa, and a chest CT revealed an infiltrative shadow in both lungs. We confirmed alveolar hemorrhage by bronchoscopy.\nThe biopsied brain material from the surgery revealed a granulomatous inflammation with geographic necrosis and multinucleated giant cells in the perivascular area of the thickened dura mater and leptomeninges (fig. ). Small vessels in the meninges were involved in the granulomatous lesions, and the lumens of the veins were often occluded. In the cerebral cortices and the white matter in these areas, hemorrhagic infarction was widely observed. After treatment with prednisolone (20 mg/day) and azathioprine (40 mg/day), the disturbance of consciousness substantially improved (GCS: E4V3M5), and the epistaxis stopped. In addition, serum creatinine and PR3-ANCA levels normalized.

Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.\nThe patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.\nOn arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.\nChest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).\nThe patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?\n\nDelta Gap: delta_gap = anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12",

In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

Our electronic medical record indicated that he had attended our outpatient hepatology clinic regularly for hepatitis B virus–related HCC with a huge 20-cm mass in the right hemiliver, which was diagnosed 5 years ago; he received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) twice for the mass at the time of diagnosis and no further invasive procedure was performed for the past years; follow-up abdominal imaging regularly at 6-month interval showed no evidence of tumor rupture and no change of necrotic mass until recently (). Current medications included sorafenib and entecavir, which he had taken for the past 5 years. He denied any history of aspiration, vomiting, hematemesis, or melena; the last esophagogastroduodenoscopy did not show presence of varix a year ago. Recently, he had intermittent right flank discomfort and a low-grade fever without chills for a year. He was a never-smoker and denied history of asthma.\nOn arrival, he was in acute respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute and was receiving oxygen at the rate of 10 L/min via a facial mask in the ambulance. Other vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 138/91 mm Hg, pulse rate 111 beats per minute, temperature 36.4℃, and oxygen saturation 90% using the full facial oxygen mask. Bilateral whole-lung wheezing was dominant and right-sided crackles were heard upon auscultation. There was no visible blood in the oral cavity. The results of the initial arterial blood gas analyses during full facial oxygen mask administration were pH 7.4, pCO2 30 mm Hg, pO2 79 mm Hg, and HCO3 20.4 mmol/L. After administering an inhaled bronchodilator with a systemic steroid, intravenous methylprednisolone 40 mg, his oxygen demand gradually decreased to 3 L/min administered via a nasal cannula.\nIn order to find the possible source of the \"hemoptysis,\" computed tomography (CT) of the chest with angiography was performed, which showed a new area of consolidation in the right basal lung suggesting necrotizing pneumonia (). Otherwise, no definite hypertrophied bronchial artery was seen and there was no possible bleeding focus.\nBlood tests showed marked leukocytosis (28,690/mL, 78% segmented neutrophils) with significantly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP, 28.11 mg/dL) and lactic acid (4.3 mmol/L).\nThere was no change in the hemoglobin level from his baseline (12.8 g/dL). His hematocrit was 38.3% and the platelet count was normal (252×103/µL). The blood urea nitrogen was not elevated (15 mg/dL); serum sodium was 134 mmol/L and the serum glucose level was 158 mg/dL. Liver function tests were also within the usual range (aspartate aminotransferase, 35 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 40 IU/L; total bilirubin, 1.1 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; and prothrombin time, 64% [patient's baseline, 69%]).\nTreatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 6 hours and levofloxacin 750 mg daily was initiated immediately and the patient was admitted to the general ward. Given the relatively mild pneumonia severity index (risk class III, 89 points) and radiologic extent of pneumonia, inflammatory markers including leukocyte count and CRP were persistently highly elevated. There were no improvements in his clinical signs (respiratory symptoms, cough, dark-colored sputum, and wheezing) or X-ray while continuing antibiotics. There was no bacterial growth on the initial blood and sputum cultures. A sputum acid fast stain for tuberculosis was negative. The urinary pneumococcal antigen test was also negative. On hospitalization day 5, his dyspnea worsened and the oxygen demand increased up to 6 L/min via nasal cannula.\nOn hospital day 7, the patient developed type 2 respiratory failure (pH, 7.13; pCO2, 105 mm Hg; pO2, 123 mm Hg; HCO3, 25.2 mmol/L) despite the use of noninvasive ventilator support overnight. Intubation was performed, and immediately afterwards, a massive volume of dark-brown secretions with a consistency like anchovy-paste was expectorated via the endotracheal tube. We thought that it was very strange because his mental status had been alert and there was no preceding aspiration event. Since the huge hepatic mass had been compressing the right lung, we considered the possibility of a connection and reviewed the initial CT scan with the Division of Thoracic Imaging, Department of Radiology. Indeed, a possible communication tract between the hepatic mass and the right middle bronchus was discovered (). A sputum smear was performed which showed numerous neutrophils and dyskeratotic cells.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit to receive mechanical ventilation and the antibiotic therapy was changed to intravenous meropenem 1 g every 8 hours. Bronchoscopy performed the next day showed obstruction of the right middle bronchus with a large amount of thick brown secretions. No overt defect was seen. After toileting, the patient was successfully extubated.\nIn the ward, he continued to expectorate dark brown sputum despite improvement in the pneumonic consolidation, laboratory findings, and oxygen demand. After 12 days of intravenous antibiotics to cover necrotizing pneumonia and continued administration of sorafenib and entecavir, the chest X-ray showed slightly improved consolidation and a sign of an air-fluid level under the right diaphragm.\nOn the 25th hospital day, a repeat CT scan was taken, which showed simultaneous disappearance of the pneumonic consolidation and the necrotic fluid within the hepatic mass (). A fistula connecting the two sides was seen (). The patient's history was carefully recorded again and the patient and his wife confirmed that there had not been any blood in the sputum at any time; it had always been brown and like the anchovy-paste (). It turned out that an intern in the ED had initially recorded it as \"hemoptysis.\" A sputum smear was performed again and showed numerous bilirubin castlike objects ().\nConsidering the short life expectancy due to HCC, he and his family did not want to receive further invasive procedures or surgery. While continuing antibiotics and tapering the steroid, the patient received inpatient rehabilitation and was successful discharged. We decided to continue antibiotics, sorafenib, and entecavir in the outpatient clinic. He is now followed-up by both respiratory physicians and hepatologists for 1 month without recurrence of pneumonia.\n\nWhat is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?\n\nFibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT)",

She also had fever and altered mentation. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and end-stage renal disease. She had been on PD for four years and denied any recent changes in technique. She had two episodes of peritonitis in the past while in Mexico but was unaware of the details of those episodes. Her surgical history was significant for appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and tubal ligation and she denied any recent abdominal procedure. She denied smoking, alcohol intake, or use of recreational drugs.\nOn examination, her blood pressure was 172/85 mm of Hg, pulse 88/min, oral temperature 39.5°C (103.1°F), respiratory rate 14/min, and oxygen saturation on room air 94%. She was lethargic and confused. She had abdominal distention and diffuse tenderness without any rebound or guarding. Her PD catheter exit site was clean and dry. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count of 14.5 × 103/μL with 87.1% granulocytes, hemoglobin of 6.3 g/dL, and hematocrit of 18.4%. Serum chemistries showed sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 2.7 mmol/L, chloride of 90 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L, blood urine nitrogen of 30 mg/dL, and creatinine of 7.7 mg/dL. Her liver function tests were within normal limits. Computed tomography of abdomen and pelvis without intravenous or oral contrast showed peritoneal thickening consistent with peritonitis, and there was no evidence of perforation or obstruction (). PD fluid analysis showed white cell count of 2173 per mm3 with 96% neutrophils and red blood cells of <3000 per mm3.\nBlood and PD fluid cultures were sent, and she was empirically treated for bacterial peritonitis with intraperitoneal cefazolin and ceftazidime. PD fluid gram stain revealed budding yeast; blood and PD fluid cultures did not reveal bacterial growth. Given the high suspicion of fungal peritonitis, immediate removal of the PD catheter was discussed with the patient. She chose not to have the catheter removed, leave to Mexico, and get treated by her own nephrologist. Hence oral fluconazole was started for presumed Candida peritonitis. However, six days later, the fungal culture [Mycosel Agar and Brain Heart Infusion Agar] of the PD fluid grew H.

            "input": "We describe the case of a 70-year-old woman who developed sudden-onset vertical separation of images. This occurred only when she specifically gazed at a distance. For example, when she looked at a plant, she saw a double image that was completely vertically separated, without overlap. The bottom image was blurry and with color but of a similar size. It appeared ghostly and almost transparent. She could almost see through it; it was diaphanous. However, it did not disappear with either eye closed. The blurry second-bottom image disappeared only with the closure of both eyes or by looking away from the object. Hence, there was no evidence of palinopsia or bona fide diplopia. This phenomenon occurred for both stationary and moving objects. A moving truck was experienced as two vertically separated images, with the bottom image described as blurry. She knew that the bottom duplicated image was not real. The duplicated image was of the same size and receded as she approached it, as demonstrated by the patient's own original rendition (Figure ).\nShe denied any visual field loss or scotoma. The color perception was preserved. She denied photopsia, micropsia, macropsia, or metamorphopsia. Visual acuity was not diminished, and she was still able to read and write with ease. She denied a headache or weakness of the arms or legs. She saw an ophthalmologist who noted full ocular motion without any subtle ophthalmoparesis on double Maddox rod testing.\nHer past medical history was significant for asthma and ulcerative colitis. Her medications included azathioprine, lansoprazole, mesalamine, and montelukast. Her mom had coronary artery disease and her dad had cerebrovascular disease. She was a non-smoker.\nOn examination, her blood pressure (BP) was 150/92 with a pulse of 71, which was regular. Her height is five feet with a weight of 185 pounds and a body mass index (BMI) of 36.1. The precordial examination was negative for a murmur and carotid bruits were absent in both internal carotid arteries. Her neurologic examination was non-revealing. Her gait station, cadence, and tandem walking were normal. Her cranial nerve examination was entirely normal. Specifically, the ocular motion was full without strabismus with a cover/uncover test and an alternate eye cover test. Accommodation was preserved without pupillary asymmetry, and visual field confrontation was normal. We were careful not to miss visual field neglect by sequential hemifield visual confrontation followed by simultaneous double hemifield confrontation. The rest of the cranial nerve function was normal. Visuomotor praxis was preserved with pantomime. No limb-kinetic or ideomotor apraxia was noted with coin deftness and transitive motor acts respectively. Ishihara plate color testing was normal. Power function was normal throughout and graded at 5/5 with the Medical Research Council (MRC) grading. Sensory examination was normal to graphesthesia and stereognosis in both hands. And deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and lively in the arms and legs. No dysmetria or intention tremor was noted in the arms. Heel to shin motion was normal in the legs bilaterally.\nA magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain shows a diffusion-weighted image (DWI) hyperintensity involving the left mesial occipital lobe; striate cortex, V1, spilling over into the adjacent visual association cortex, V2, indicating an ischemic infarct (Figure ).\nThere was a corresponding hypointensity on gradient echo imaging (GRE) in the region of V2 (Figure ).\nA carotid duplex scan was normal. A transcranial Doppler (TCD) with a two Megahertz crystal with the insonation of temporal, transorbital, and sub-occipital windows bilaterally showed monophasic waveforms with no high-velocity jets, which was normal. Due to the embolic nature of the ischemic infarct and a normal event monitor, a cardiac loop monitor was implanted to rule out paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. A transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study did not reveal a patent foramen ovale or any evidence of cardiac vegetations or intra-cavitary thrombus. The automated Humphrey visual field test showed a subtle and patchy incongruous right homonymous hemianopia (Figure ); the patient herself did not notice any visual field deficits.\nThe patient was defaulted to 81 milligrams (mg) of aspirin daily.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?\n\nMean Arterial Pressure (MAP): MAP = 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure)",

She reported no previous history of liver test abnormality or liver disease. She was not using any hepatotoxic prescription or over the counter medications or supplements and reported rare consumption of alcohol. Besides, she had no family history of liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, autoimmune disorders or diabetes mellitus.\nThe physical examination was significant for obesity with weight 66 kg, height 146 cm, body mass index (BMI) 31, hepatomegaly, nonpalpable spleen, and lack of stigmata of chronic liver disease. Extensive laboratory workup revealed normal complete blood count, renal function, serum electrolytes, iron studies, serum immunoglobulin levels, and ceruloplasmin. Also, hepatitis B and C serologic tests and autoimmune markers were negative. Fasting lipid profile revealed dyslipidemia (total cholesterol 260 mg/dL, triglycerides 267 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 45 mg/dL, and low density lipoprotein 170 mg/dL). Fasting blood glucose was 165 mg/dL with simultaneous fasting insulin level of 4.8 mill international units/liter and a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score of 2.9, thus has insulin resistance. Hemoglobin (Hgb) A1c level at this time was 6.8% which was higher than previous values from eight months prior (6.1%), 16 months prior (6.1%) and 39 months prior (4.8%).\nUltrasonographic evaluation of the abdomen revealed hepatomegaly, hyperechogenic liver indicative of severe hepatic steatosis, an ill-defined liver mass, and standard spleen size. Magnetic resonance examination defined the liver mass as hemangioma in addition to hepatomegaly and severe hepatic steatosis. Ultrasound-guided liver biopsy (sample size of 3.5 cm) showed severe macrosteatosis with mild lobular and periportal inflammation associated with focal hepatocyte damage (Figure , Panel A). Trichrome staining revealed focal portal, periportal and perisinusoidal fibrosis consistent with stage II (Figure , Panel B) with a NASH activity score (NAS) of 7. The patient was instructed to exercise routinely and follow a healthy diet. She was seen in follow-up for three months at which time her weight was unchanged.

The patient underwent a transsphenoidal approach operation due to a pituitary adenoma 5 years previously and had been followed up for panhypopituitarism and diabetes mellitus at our institution.\nThe patient complained of mild dyspnea 10 hours after the traffic accident. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) revealed pH 7.423, PaCO2 37.3 mmHg, PaO2 50.1 mmHg, SaO2 86.5% (FiO2 0.2). The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was increased to 53 but his chest x-ray was normal. On the 3rd hospital day, dyspnea and hypoxemia worsened and chest computed tomography (CT) was performed due to suspected PE. Chest CT scan showed thromboembolism in the right interlobar pulmonary artery, right lower lobe segmental artery and subsegmental pulmonary artery (). Heparin treatment was initiated immediately and dyspnea and hypoxemia improved. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on the 4th hospital day without showing any abnormality or thrombus. On the 7th hospital day, left lower limb venography was taken but there was no venous thrombus and an inferior vena cava filter was not inserted. The patient was scheduled for an operation 11 days after the accident.\nDuring heparin administration activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was maintained between 60 and 67 sec and heparin was stopped at midnight on the day before the operation. Prothrombin time and aPTT were within normal range on the day of operation. Laboratory tests were within normal range except BUN/Cr which was increased to 23.7/1.5 mg/dl.\nThe patient was not premedicated. On arrival in the operating room, standard monitoring devices were applied. After Allen's test, the left radial artery was cannulated for continuous blood pressure monitoring and the initial blood pressure (BP) was 120/70 mmHg. 5 L of 100% O2 was applied to the patient via oxygen mask and initial ABGA showed pH 7.43, PaCO2 38.1 mmHg, PaO2 102.9 mmHg, and SaO2 98%. Spinal anesthesia was administered with the patient in the right lateral position using a 25-gauge Quincke spinal needle at the level of the L3-4 interspace under standard aseptic conditions. A total of 12 mg of 0.5% tetracaine, mixed with saline, the patient's CSF, and epinephrine 1 : 200,000 was administered slowly to the patient. The patient was then positioned supine and a sensory block to T10 was confirmed by pin-prick test 5 min later. During spinal anesthesia, 700 ml of Hartmann's solution was administered to the patient and there were no significant changes in BP or heart rate (HR). Forty min after spinal anesthesia, a pneumatic tourniquet was inflated on the left thigh. It was inflated to 350 mmHg, without prior use of an Esmarch bandage. Immediately after the skin incision was made, the patient became unresponsive with BP 50/30 mmHg and HR 40 bpm. Ephedrine hydrochloride 8 mg was administered intravenously followed by another 12 mg but BP did not increase. Phenylephrine 300 µg was administered and endotracheal intubation was performed immediately and the patient was ventilated with 100% oxygen. BP increased to 80/70 mmHg but cardiac arrest then followed, and external cardiac massage was initiated. The patient received epinephrine 1 mg and atropine 0.5 mg repeatedly for 4 times without any response and infusion of epinephrine 0.1 µg/kg/min and norepinephrine 0.1 µg/kg/min was started. Fifteen min after cardiopulmonary resuscitation was instituted, HR increased to 140 bpm and BP increased to 140/90 mmHg. ABGA at that time showed pH 7.127, PaCO2 37.2 mmHg, PaO2 144.4 mmHg, HCO3 12.0 mmol/L, BE -15.9 mmol/L, and SaO2 98.1%. Sodium bicarbonate 200 mEq was intravenously administered because of metabolic acidosis. BP was maintained by continuously infusing epinephrine and norepinephrine. Emergent TEE revealed multiple emboli in the right atrium and the interatrial septum to be bulging into the left atrium (). After the TEE diagnosis of PE, vital signs improved (BP 120/70 mmHg, HR 110 bpm) and the operation resumed. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) with 100% oxygen applied through an endotracheal tube (anesthesia and operation time were 135 min and 50 min in length, respectively). On admission to the ICU, mechanical ventilation was continued with FiO2 1.0. ABGA showed pH 7.165, PaCO2 66.6 mmHg, PaO2 66.6 mmHg, and SaO2 87.1%.\nHeparin treatment was initiated immediately on arrival to ICU and D-dimer was 9467 ng/ml. D-dimer increased to 52,796 ng/ml on postoperative day (POD) 2. PaO2 continuously improved and ABGA on POD 7 was pH 7.485, PaCO2 32.4 mmHg, PaO2 142.2 mmHg, and SaO2 99.0% (FiO2 0.4). The patient was extubated on POD 9. The patient was on heparin treatment for 20 days. D-dimer started to decrease and chest CT and echocardiography did not show any pulmonary or intracardiac emboli. The patient's vital signs came to within normal range and the patient was transferred to the general ward on POD 30.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?\n\nAdjusted Body Weight: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg))",

She has been treated for hepatitis B with nucleoside analogue before the hepatectomy. A pathological diagnosis of moderately differentiated HCC was subsequently established. We followed up at interval of 2–3 months after the hepatectomy. During post-surgery follow-up, abdominal ultrasonography detected a 36-mm hypoechoic tumor in segment 7 of the liver. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a 40-mm tumor adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and right hepatic vein (RHV). The tumor was well enhanced in the arterial phase and washed out in the portal venous and delayed phases, suggesting HCC recurrence (Fig. ). No nodule suggesting HCC was identified elsewhere in the liver. Neither lymph-node swelling nor metastasis to other organs was detected. The following laboratory data were obtained: white blood cell count (3000/µL), hemoglobin (10.1 g/dL), platelet count (16.5 × 104/µL), C-reactive protein (2.98 mg/dL), urea nitrogen (9.2 mg/dL), creatinine (0.51 mg/dL), total protein (6.3 g/dL), albumin (3.1 g/dL), total bilirubin (0.4 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (28 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (30 IU/L), glutamyltransferase (16 IU/L), lactate dehydrogenase (179 U/L), alkaliphosphatase (192 U/L), prothrombin time (115.3%), and indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (7.0%). α-Fetoprotein (AFP) (12,371.5 ng/mL; normal range < 10 ng/mL) and PIVKA-II (208 mAU/mL; normal range; < 40 mAU/mL) were both significantly elevated. Considering that the patient was still 20 weeks pregnant, delivery was not viable. However, surgery could not be delayed any longer given the rapid tumor growth, which could likely be associated with pregnancy. After discussion with at a cancer board consisting of experts from the departments of gastroenterology, obstetrics and gynecology, and surgery, as well as obtaining appropriate informed consent from the patient and her family, we decided to perform hepatic resection after abortion. Subsequently, abortion surgery was performed at 21 weeks and 2 days of pregnancy, followed by subsegmentectomy of liver segment 7 under general and epidural anesthesia 6 days later. Mental care for the patient was provided by obstetricians, surgeons, and nurses before and after abortion. After mobilizing the right lobe of the liver, we identified the Glissonian pedicle (G) 7 and injected indigo carmine under US guidance to mark the perfusion area. Thereafter, hepatic resection was initiated using an ultrasonic dissector under the Pringle’s maneuver. After identifying the G7, a clamp test was performed to reconfirming the ischemic area before ligating and cutting it. We continued hepatic resection along the RHV, exfoliated a tumor within the vicinity of a root of the RHV, and subsequently completed subsegmentectomy of liver segment 7 (Fig. ). The surgery lasted 274 min, with an estimated blood loss of 940 mL. Macroscopically, the whitish tumor with a maximum diameter of 4.0 cm was simple nodular type and showed expansive growth (Fig. ). A pathological diagnosis of moderately differentiated HCC, grade II, eg, fc (−), sf (+), s0, vp0, vv0, b0, im0, and sm (−) was thereafter established. Tumor cells showed a moderate degree of atypia, as well as a cord-like or pseudoglandular arrangement associated with abundant eosinophilic vesicles and a rich nucleoplasm. Given the good postoperative course, without particular complications, the patient was discharged 10 days after surgery. Approximately 2 years after surgery, the patient remains alive without recurrence, while both AFP and PIVKA-II were within normal limits.\n\nWhat is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?\n\nFibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT)",

Further examination revealed prolapse of the anterior leaflet and rupture of the chordae tendineae. Baseline serum creatinine level was 102.5 μmol/L, and hemoglobin level was 12.6 g/dL. He underwent surgery for chordal replacement with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene chordae tendineae. And mitral annuloplasty was performed with a flexible annuloplasty Medtronic Duran ring. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and postoperative transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated no residual mitral regurgitation. The patient was discharged in good condition one week after surgery. At the time of discharge, serum creatinine level was 87.5 μmol/L.\nSeven weeks after surgery he presented with anemia and “dark urine” and was admitted to our hospital. Investigations showed haemoglobin 4.5 g/dL, hematocrit 12%, undetectable haptoglobin, reticulocyte count 9%, slightly depressed platelet count 75,000/μL, serum lactic dehydrogenase 3600 IU/L, and total bilirubin of 69.86 μmol/L (indirect of 57.1 μmol/L). Peripheral blood smear demonstrated mechanical hemolysis with schistocytosis and red cell fragmentation (Fig. ). Creatinine levels ranged from256 to 362 μmol/L. Coomb’s test, Ham test and sugar water test were negative. Expression of CD55 and CD59 for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was normal. Drug-induced hemolytic anemia was not apparent, because there was no reduction of hemolysis after stopping the administration of any drug. On transthoracic echocardiography, mitral valve jet was found and judged to be mild, originating from the centre of the valve and striking the annuloplasty ring (Fig. ). The velocity of the mitral regurgitation jet was 2.3 m/s. The investigation did not show any evidence of a structural defect of the valve or the annuloplasty ring. Predonisolone for the possible microangiopathy was used. Three times of plasmapheresis and blood transfusion of 15 units red blood cells were required. After these treatments, the anemia and dark urine did not improve, with a creatinine level at 256 μmol/L. Based on previous experience with hemolytic patients following MVR and useless of aggressive conservative therapy, we decided to do reoperation for intracardiac inspection and mitral valve replacement after a detailed communication with the patient, despite RF. During the intraoperative inspection, there was no ring dehiscence or suture-related tear of the valve tissue. The annuloplasty ring was well endothelialized. Chordal attachments were intact. However, the new artificial chordae tendinae was completely non-endothelialized (Fig. ). The plasty ring was excised and the mitral valve was replaced with a 27-mm bileaflet prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences). The hemolytic anemia resolved gradually after the reoperation. But the RF persisted after surgery and the patient was transferred to the department of hematology for hemodialysis. Three months later, the LDH level gradually fell to 224 U/L.

Magnetic resonance imaging of renal arteries was initially planned to exclude renal artery stenosis, but the examination revealed multiple cysts of varying sizes in both the kidneys and the liver, consistent with ADPKD(). There was no adrenal mass or renal artery stenosis.\nAfter the diagnosis of ADPKD had been established, the patient received valsartan 80mg daily without further requirement of potassium().

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nCKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate: GFR = 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coefficient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

After then, he had suffered from recurrent sinusitis and otitis media which failure to treat even though high-dose, oral amoxicillin therapy, consequently. The parent and older brother were healthy, but 2 maternal uncles were previously diagnosed as XLA at the adulthood ().\nPhysical examination showed normal growth and development, body weight was 10.6 kg (25th–50th percentile) and height was 77.2 cm (10th–25th percentile). There were no abnormal morphologic findings except absence of tonsil, purulent postnasal drip and palpable lymph-node. The fluid collection and cloudiness of the ear drum were observed.\nLaboratory tests revealed as follows: white blood cells, 9,700/µL (neutrophils, 25.0%; lymphocyte, 63.8%); serum IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE levels were 151, 0, 11 mg/dL, and 54.7 KU/L; significantly decreased levels of CD19+ B cells in the peripheral blood (1.1%, 59/µL); the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio was 2.7:1, respectively.\nRadiologic examination showed normal finding in chest X-ray, however there was mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses and no adenoid shadow in paranasal sinuses views. Based on the family history of XLA, agammaglobulinemia and absent circulating-CD19+ B cells, and absence of adenoid and tonsil with recurrent sinusitis and otitis media, he was diagnosed as XLA. Mutational analysis for BTK gene of the proband and family members was performed to identify the underlying genetic defect. Informed consent was obtained before the start of the study. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. All coding exons with flanking intronic regions of the BTK gene were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. Sequence chromatograms were compared with the reference sequence of BTK, NM_000061.2. As a result, the proband (III:2) was found to be hemizygous for a 1-bp deletion (c.82delC), which was predicted to result in frameshift at the 28th codon (Arg) and premature termination at the 5th downstream amino acid of the BTK protein (p.Arg28Alafs*5) (). A family study revealed that two maternal uncles (II:1 and II:2) were hemizygous patients and maternal grandmother (I:2), mother (II:4), and cousin (III:4) were heterozygous carriers for the same mutation.\nAfter diagnosis of XLA, a scheduled Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy (400 mg/kg, monthly) was started.

A physical examination suggested that there was severe cervical spondylitis involving thoracolumbar vertebral column, without lower limb neurological involvement. No cardiovascular system abnormality was detected.\nThe airway examination showed adequate mouth opening with artificial dentures, Mallampati grade III restricted neck mobility. A preoperative assessment for difficult intubation was made.\nRadiographs of the vertebral column revealed ankylosis of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinous processes showing posterior joint involvement, resorption of the anterior surfaces of the vertebral bodies and calcification and ossification of the posterior ligaments and surrounding soft tissues.\nFollowing the traditional anesthetic approach to ankylosing patients, we decided to opt for securing the airway using awake endotracheal intubation; however, the patient did not give his consent for this. A difficult intubation cart, which had a selection of oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal airway, gum elastic bougie, fiberoptic bronchoscope, cricothyroidotomy, and other aids, was kept ready.\nOn the day of the surgery, the patient was premedicated with oral ranitidine 150 mg and diazepam 5 mg, two hours before surgery, with a sip of water, and injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly one hour before surgery. Preparation for fiberoptic intubation was done. Nasal patency was checked and the nasal cavity prepared with oxymetazoline nasal drops. In the operation room the patient was made to lie supine with the head adequately supported on three pillows and routine monitors, such as, the electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure, and pulse oximeter and capnograph were placed. The IV line, with a 18 Gauge canula, was started. Anesthesia was induced with IV injection propofol 2 mg/kg, slowly, in titrated doses, with fentanyl 2 μg/kg. The anesthetist had to use a higher footstep than normal to get the desired level. We opted for fiberoptic bronchoscopy, but as the heart rate increased to 144/min and the blood pressure increased to 180/118 mmHg, we administered a further bolus dose of 50 mg of propofol to increase the depth of anesthesia. The patient's heart rate, and blood pressure stabilized, but the patient started desaturating with apneic spells, so we decided to abandon the procedure. The patient was allowed to wake up. Regional anesthesia was taken as the next option. Even after three attempts by expert hands no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained through the spinal needle.\nTaylor's approach was attempted. Clear CSF was obtained through the spinal needle and 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine and 25μg/kg fentanyl was injected intrathecally. Due to the spinal deformity, we were not able to achieve the appropriate position for intrathecal block. Therefore, we carried out some maneuvres; we placed a pillow beneath the left shoulder to make the spine of the scapula perpendicular to the table, and the operating table (OT) was tilted 20° to the right, to straighten the spine and to make it parallel to the floor.\nThe block was adequate with sensory block up to T4 and adequate motor blockade upto T6. The vital signs remained stable. Fluid calculations and management of blood pressure were very important in this patient with severe lung disease. Prone position had to be given carefully, with bolsters confirming to the contours of the patient, to avoid fractures.\nThere were no intraoperative problems throughout the procedure, which was completed within three hours.

He had been treated with androgen deprivation therapy in the past, along with three doses of zoledronic acid for bone metastases. The bone pain was not controlled with the above regimen and it was decided to switch him to Denosumab. He received the dose approximately 13 days prior to hospitalization. Vitals at admission were significant for a blood pressure (BP) of 160/90 mmHg. Pertinent findings on physical examination were the presence of bilateral lower extremity edema and negative Chvostek and Trousseau's signs. The electrocardiogram showed a prolonged QT interval. Laboratory studies on admission revealed sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4.9 mEq/L, chloride of 105 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 23 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 22 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.34 mg/dL, glucose of 133 mg/dL, and calcium of 4.5 mg/dL, with albumin being 2.5 g/dL at admission. Phosphorus level was 6.1 mg/dL. The ionized calcium level at admission was 0.58 mmol/L. Laboratory studies done 13 days prior, when the drug was given, showed serum calcium of 8.4 mg/dL with an albumin of 2.9 g/dL. His vitamin D levels had not been checked prior to the administration of Denosumab. After admission to the hospital, his vitamin D 25-OH level was low at 12.1 ng/mL and vitamin D 1,25 dihydroxy level was high at 95.4 pg/mL. His initial PTH level was high at 440.7 pg/mL.\nHe was started on 50,000 IU of ergocalciferol every 7 days, 2 mcg of calcitriol twice daily, and high doses of IV and oral calcium supplementation. Over the next 16 days, the patient received high doses of calcium carbonate; he was first started on 5 gm twice daily of calcium carbonate and 1337 mg of calcium acetate. Since the ionized calcium levels were consistently below 0.60 mmol/L, he was slowly increased to 10 gm twice daily of calcium carbonate and 3335 mg of calcium acetate thrice daily with meals. During the hospitalization, he received a total of 80 gm of IV calcium gluconate and 370 gm of oral calcium, but the highest ionized calcium level that could be achieved was 0.71 mmol/L. Figures and show the calcium and ionized calcium levels during the hospital while receiving oral and IV calcium supplementation.\nHe continued to have worsening lower-extremity edema, for which he was started on treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to help with diuresis as well as with the hypocalcemia. His renal function kept worsening during his hospital stay and his creatinine reached 4.12 mg/dL. During workup for his renal failure, he was found to have hydronephrosis due to the spreading tumor. The options available were either placement of percutaneous nephrostomy tubes by interventional radiology to relieve the hydronephrosis and continued attempts at correction of his electrolytes via medical management or placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter and starting hemodialysis. After a discussion of the risks and benefits of each procedure and the overall prognosis of his condition, the patient opted for hemodialysis. Hemodialysis was initiated on the sixteenth day of hospitalization. He was dialysed daily for the next nine days with a high calcium bath along with two- to three-liter ultrafiltration daily to help get fluid off. His edema improved significantly, his serum calcium levels came above 8 mg/dL, and his ionized calcium stayed above 1 mmol/L without any IV supplementation; however, the oral supplementation with calcium acetate and 10 gm of calcium carbonate twice daily was continued. Due to the poor prognosis of the underlying disease, it was decided to send him home on hospice after arrangement of outpatient hemodialysis to prevent further hypocalcemia and maintain euvolemia.

He had no surface lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings included: white blood cell (WBC) count, 4.2 × 109/L; hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL; platelet count, 106 × 109/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 1662 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 6562 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1407 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 509 IU/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), 130 IU/L; total bilirubin, 2.7 mg/dL; prothrombin time (PT), 20.3 s; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.73; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 34.4 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.4 mg/dL. Serologic tests were all negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Computed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed no distinct nodules or masses in the liver, but mild splenomegaly, multiple hypodense splenic lesions, and para-aortic lymph node swelling (Fig. a–c). Antibiotics were administered intravenously for suspected acute cholangitis and sepsis, but the fever persisted. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 2 days later newly depicted gallbladder wall thickening and ascites (Figs. , ). On the same night, the patient presented with grade II hepatic encephalopathy, with blood tests showing a decrease in platelet count and worsening liver function suggestive of “acute type” ALF with hepatic coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While consideration was being given to treating acute liver failure, the patient suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation and died despite immediate resuscitation measures on day 3 of hospitalization.\nGiven the rapid clinical course, an autopsy was performed in this patient with suspected ALF likely due to drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis of indeterminate etiology, circulatory disturbance, metabolic disease, or malignant cells including malignant lymphoma. This led to the patient being diagnosed with malignant, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterized by multiple lymph-node, as well as multi-organ (i.e., spleen, liver, lung, and prostate) involvement: (1) general swelling of lymph nodes in the para-abdominal aorta (Fig. a), peripancreatic, peribronchial, pulmonary hilar, subclavicular regions, as well as in the pelvis, especially around the iliac arteries, measuring up to 60 mm in diameter; (2) presence of multiple whitish splenic nodules (Fig. b) with the entire spleen shown to be microscopically infiltrated by tumor cells (Fig. a); (3) irregular geographical morphology of the liver (Fig. c) with the lymphoma cells mainly infiltrating the portal areas (Fig. b); (4) involvement of the right lobe of the lung; (5) involvement of both lobes of the prostate consequent to outer connective tissue involvement (Fig. c). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the lymph nodes were shown to have medium-sized irregular nuclei and small nucleoli with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, thus showing diffuse proliferation characterized by the presence of large numbers of small T-cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD20 (Fig. a), CD79a (Fig. b), bcl-2 (Fig. c), and MUM1 (Fig. d), but negative for CD3 (Fig. e), CD10, bcl-6, and cyclin D1, with a Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) of 16% (Fig. f).

He was treated with an intravenous saline infusion, subcutaneous calcitonin, and intravenous glucocorticoids, followed by intravenous bisphosphonates. Due to his persistent hypercalcemia he was subsequently given 120 mg denosumab (Prolia). During hospitalization, there was significant improvement in his mental status concurrently with the normalization of his calcium level, which was 9.44 mg/dl at discharge.\nHis past history was remarkable for his 2016 diagnosis of Rai stage IV chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The fluorescence in situ hybridization reaction revealed the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del (17p)) in 20% of B-cell lymphocytes. In addition, in a bone marrow biopsy, the patient was found to have unmutated IGHV gene status and ZAP 70 expression in leukemia cells.\nIn 09/2017 he was admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine because of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Treatment with a high dose glucocorticoid was started, followed by a slow tapering down of the dose. In 12/2017 he was again admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine with left hemiparesis, dysarthria, and left facial nerve palsy. Complete right carotid occlusion was found in the CT angiography.\nAfter discharge, he was treated with 2 courses of a Rituximab + Bendamustine protocol with a significant decrease in lymphocytes counts. In September 2018 treatment with the second line agent Ibrutinib was started. One month later, he developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm. Six days before the present admission, the patient was hospitalized because of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with no evidence of myocardial ischemia. Ibrutinib was stopped because it was presumed to be the cause of the arrhythmia. During his present hospitalization additional laboratory tests revealed an elevated LDH level of 2250 U/l (reference range: 230–480), an alkaline phosphatase level of 220 U/l (reference range: 30–120), and low levels of PTH: 4.8 pg/ml (reference range: 18.4–81), 25 hydroxyvitamin D level of 52 mmol/l (reference range: 75–220) with normal 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D level of 61.3 nmol/l (reference range: 50–190), WBC 108.000 (reference range: 4.5–11.5 K/μl), Lymphocytes 57%, PLT count of 88.000 (reference range: 150–450 K/μl).\nIn the setting of his elevated LDH level, further decrease in his PLT level to 45.000 and severe hypercalcemia, it was decided to perform a positron emission tomography/computed tomography to assess the possibility of Richter transformation. The scan revealed a 1.3 cm nodule with an intensive uptake of tracer in the upper left lobe of the lung and in vertebra D 7, suspicious of metastasis (Fig. ).\nHe underwent a bronchoscopy with a transbronchial biopsy of the lesion. Non-small cell carcinoma displaying positive CK 7 and negative to TTF-1, napsin-A, and p 40 immunostaining was diagnosed. An epidermal growth factor genotype was negative for mutations. Immunohistochemical analysis was negative for ALK and ROS1 protein rearrangement as well as PDL1 expression. He underwent 1 course of chemotherapy in September 2019 that included carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembroluzumab. Results of the molecular analysis of the tumor were negative for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genotype mutations, ALK and ROS 1 rearrangement, and PDL-1 protein expression. He then began treatment with venetoclax for his refractory CLL.\nTen days after starting therapy with venetoclax, he was admitted to the internal medicine department with large left upper lobe pneumonia. A chest CT revealed a large infiltrate with an air bronchogram. A subsequent urine antigen test was positive for legionella pneumonia. He completed treatment with respiratory quinolone for 21 days and was returned to oncological and hematological supervision.\nThe patient received a second course of chemotherapy, but 4 days later he was admitted with suspected pneumonia and despite the broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, respiratory failure developed and he passed away.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

She reported that her symptoms started immediately post-procedure and that she continued to have multiple episodes of mostly clear vomit with streaks of blood. She also reported throat, chest, and epigastric pain and was unable to eat anything since the procedure due to her symptoms.\nHer past medical history included hypertension, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, variceal hemorrhage, gall stones and Graves disease. She was on propranolol, lactulose, alprazolam and amlodipine at home. Social history was significant for heavy alcohol use for over 30 years, which she quit following an episode of variceal bleeding. She had no episodes of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding since her last EGD and banding. On physical examination, she was an ill-appearing female, had dry oral mucosa, tachycardic, had epigastric and RUQ tenderness with negative Murphy's sign, and no rebound or guarding. During the interview, she vomited small amounts of non-bloody white material several times.\nOn presentation, her laboratory tests were as follows: WBC 13.1, Hb/Hct 14/39.7, platelets 260; Na 152, K 3.6, Cl 112, CO2 22, BUN 30, Cr 0.87, glc 146; lipase 93, Alk Phos 113, AST/ALT 48/75, lactic acid 2.0 and drug screen was positive for propofol.\nThe patient was admitted for dehydration due to nausea and vomiting. She was started on IV fluids, anti-emetics, pain control and kept NPO (nothing by mouth). Her dyselectrolytemia improved following hydration and her diet was advanced on the following day. She could not tolerate oral intake and reported worsening dysphagia, nausea and vomiting. Over the course of next 2 days, the patient continued to have worsening dysphagia with no relief from anti-emetics. A barium swallow was administered which showed a complete obstruction of the distal esophagus (). The differential for obstruction was thought to be either from local edema from the banding procedure, impacted food or a hematoma from the procedure. An EGD was performed; the scope was advanced to 34 cm to the level of obstruction and it was noted to have a band with entrapped varix in the center of the lumen surrounded by fibrotic material closing off the rest of the lumen (). Several attempts were made with biopsy forceps to reopen the lumen that resulted in a small amount of bleeding and the scope was removed at this point. Conservative management of the patient continued, i.e., NPO with intravenous hydration and pain control. Her symptoms improved over the course of the next 3–4 days and she started tolerating diet advancement and was subsequently discharged.\nShe presented the next day with a recurrence of similar symptoms, i.e., dysphagia, abdominal pain and vomiting. A repeat barium swallow showed patency of the esophagus with a parallel channel that retained contrast much later than the initial swallow, suggestive of an esophageal tear with an intramural dissection of 6 cm to the level of gastro-esophageal junction ().\nThe patient was kept NPO with peripheral parenteral nutrition and close monitoring for possible esopheageal perforation. Over the course of the next several days, the diet was carefully advanced with inputs from gastroenterologist and surgical consultants. After 5 days, the patient reported much improvement in her symptoms and was able to tolerate a full diet for the first time.\nA repeat barium swallow was obtained prior to discharge that showed no obstruction or dissection.

Physical examination revealed body weight 17.5 kg (50th percentile), body height 100 cm (15~50th percentile), blood pressure 230/120 mmHg, heart rate 138 /min, and decreased skin turgor. There was no focal neurological deficit, blood pressure discrepancy between upper and lower extremities, palpable mass, nor any appreciation of an abdominal thrill. Laboratory studies revealed serum Na+ 124 mmol/L, K+ 2.4 mmol/L, Cl− 87 mmol/L, Ca2+ 8.5 mg/dL, HCO3− 34.5 mEq/L, creatinine 0.41 mg/dL, albumin 3.4 g/dL, IgG 247 mg/dL, and osmolality 290 mOsm/KgH2O.

Survey for possible glomerulonephritis demonstrated the absence of anti-streptolysin O, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, ANA, and normal immunoglobulin A, C3, and C4 levels. In addition, work-up for secondary hypertension included: free T4 1.51 (normal range 0.8–2.0 ng/dL), TSH 5.7 (normal range 0.25–5.00 μIU/mL), cortisol 40.18 (normal range 4.3–25 μg/dL), ACTH 9.32 (normal range < 46 pg/mL), renin 1745 (normal range 2–15 ng/L), aldosterone 92.6 (normal range 4–25 ng/dL), and urine vanillylmandelic acid 3.8 (normal range 1.9–9.9 g/day). Renal ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic right kidney (7.6 cm in length) and small left kidney (5.3 cm in length). Due to the presence of hyperreninemic hypertension, natriuretic-hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and nephrotic range proteinuria, HHS was highly suspected. Computed tomography angiography confirmed high-grade renal artery stenosis with hypoplasia of the left kidney (Fig. ).\nIn terms of management for this case, we began with volume repletion by normal saline administration. Subsequently, his blood pressure declined from 210/120 mmHg to 180/90 mmHg. Intravenous calcium channel blocker was used to treat his hypertensive emergency, while oral captopril was prescribed for RAA axis blockage after diagnosis of unilateral renal artery stenosis. The systolic blood pressure gradually declined to 150~160 mmHg on the 3rd day. Potassium supplement was infused for his profound hypokalemia and generalized muscle weakness. Due to the severity of left renal artery stenosis, he was not a candidate for angiographic intervention, and decision was made to proceed with left nephrectomy. Overall, electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia and hypokalemia were corrected within 1 week after admission, and resolution of polyuria, polydipsia, proteinuria, and hypertension were achieved 2 weeks after nephrectomy (Additional file : Table S1).\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Anion Gap: albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL))",

However, she vomited once in the morning a week before presentation and was unable to bathe without assistance two days prior to admission. Blood tests revealed severe renal impairment. The patient was referred to the department of internal medicine for consultation on the day of admission. This patient’s medical history included medial osteoarthritis of the left knee, lumbar spinal canal stenosis, and an L2 vertebral fracture two years before admission. There were no malignant findings. She was followed by her general practitioner for blood tests every six months. Her creatinine was 0.64 mg/dL eight months prior to the hospital visit and 1.14 mg/dL one month prior to the hospital admission with no further investigation. Her vital statistics were as follows: height 142 cm, weight 41.8 kg; blood pressure 145/76 mmHg, pulse rate 74 beats/min, body temperature 36.4°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 98%. Blood tests revealed severe renal dysfunction with the following levels: blood urea nitrogen 139.9 mg/dL, creatinine 16.81 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/l, K 7.5 mEq/l, Cl 100 mEq/l, Ca 8.1 mg/dL, P 11.4 mg/dL, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 101 mm/hour.

The lab tests indicated metabolic acidosis with an enlarged anion gap.\nEmergency hemodialysis with a right internal jugular vein catheter was initiated on the second day of admission. Considering further rapid progression, steroids were urgently administered on the third day of admission due to suspicion of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephropathy. This was performed prior to a bone marrow biopsy and immunofixation electrophoresis. Considering renal atrophy and renal damage due to malignancy, an abdominal CT, head MRI, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed. However, there was no renal atrophy, and no obvious malignant findings were observed (Figure ). Additional tests for antinuclear antibody, anti-streptolysin 0 antibody, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, and anticardiolipin antibody were all normal. The serum immunoelectrophoresis that we had submitted on the second day of admission came back on the eighth day, and the IgG, IgA, and IgM had decreased. On the twentieth day of admission, a renal biopsy of the right kidney was performed. Crystals in the tubules and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-negative urinary casts suggested acute kidney injury associated with cast nephropathy (Figures -). Additional investigations were performed to determine the cause of the cast nephropathy. On the 33rd day of admission, Bence-Jones protein-λ M protein was detected in the urine. And IgD-λ M protein and Bence-Jones protein-λ protein were detected on the 36th day (Figure ). Additional blood data showed a λ type free light chain of 8440 mg/L (κ/λ ratio of <0.001). This indicated light chain MM or monoclonal gammaglobulinemia (MGRS). Bone marrow examination showed scattered plasma cell nests of 23%, which was consistent with MM (Figure ). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with IgD-λ type MM. There were indications for treatment. However, based on a discussion with a hematologist, it was concluded that active treatment for myeloma would not improve the patient’s condition. This patient was bedridden and her condition was poor. The side effects of the treatment could have impinged on her appetite and condition. When we discussed this with the patient, she refused to undergo chemotherapy or further active treatment. As a result of this discussion, we decided to treat her with palliative measures. For the anemia, we employed a blood transfusion and a darbepoetin alfa injection. Maintenance dialysis was initiated for the chronic renal failure. As it was difficult for the patient to return home, she was admitted to a nursing care facility.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

Urine smear disclosed 30–50 red blood cells per high power field (). Four months before admission, a routine blood exam had been within normal limits, except for a urinalysis that had shown 10 red blood cells per high power field. Past medical history was negative for prior upper respiratory tract infections or any infections of clinical relevance. At the time of admission, physical examination was normal; blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg. A renal ultrasound showed kidneys with normal shape and measurements with echogenic alterations, while all complementary serologic studies were noncontributory: blood, urine, and throat cultures, HIV, hepatitis B and C serologies, complement levels, p- and c-ANCA antibodies, antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies, and electrophoretic proteinogram. Podocyturia was performed as described previously []. Briefly, the podocyte count was assessed by counting in urinary smears the number of cells in 10 microscopy fields of ×20. The podocyte count was 2.1 cells per ×20 field and the number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 166 (). Podocytes were identified by tagging synaptopodin (ab109560 Alexa Fluor®, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), an specific marker of podocytes, to establish their identity by immunofluorescence techniques using a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, Abcam, Cambridge, Uk). The smears were analyzed employing an epifluorescence microscopy, Nikon Eclipse E200. This result was compared with 10 controls (6 males and 4 females; mean age: 20 ± 2.1 years, with no past history of morbidities: serum creatinine, 0.7 ± 0.1 mg/dL; mean 24-hour urinary albumin excretion, 66 ± 12 mg/day. The mean podocyte count was 0.11 ± 0.3 cells per ×20 field, while the mean number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 8.3. One day after admission, a kidney biopsy was performed and was consistent with IgA nephropathy, with the following Oxford score over 14 glomeruli: M1E0S0T0. The immunofluorescence was positive for IgA and mesangial C3 deposits +++/4 y C3. Due to the rapidly progressive course of the altered kidney function, oral methyl prednisone 1 mg/kg/day was started. Two weeks later when creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL, amiloride was started at 5 mg/day. Four weeks after initiation of therapy, proteinuria and hematuria were negative and serum creatinine dropped to 0.7 mg/dL (). Two consecutive podocyturia tests were similar to controls after one year of follow-up. Current therapy consists of amiloride 5 mg/day and valsartan 80 mg/day.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nCKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate: GFR = 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coefficient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

            "input": "A 73-year-old man was referred to our hospital by his primary care doctor because of a bulge in his right inguinal region. The patient reported this bulge had been present since his adolescence. The hernia had been reducible until age 55, and had become irreducible, thereafter. Medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma and cerebral infarction. He was currently taking one aspirin daily. The patient was 159 cm tall and weighed 84 kg, with a body mass index of 32.2 kg/m2. On physical examination, the bulge in his right inguinal region was roughly the size of an infant's head and the bottom of scrotum descended to his knees in the upright position (Fig. ). Laboratory tests indicated a hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) concentration of 7.0% and a urine glucose concentration of 4+. Lung function tests identified restrictive lung function and pre-operative cardiac ultrasound revealed no local asynergy. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging identified the sigmoid colon with a large amount of feces and the great omentum as part of the contents of the hernia (Fig. ). Although the hernia was irreducible, the patient was planned to undergo an elective surgery for hernia repair due to absence of symptoms of incarceration. Informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient achieved a weight reduction of 3 kg within 3 months prior to surgery.\nCT on the day of admission showed a hernia sac of 2263 ml, with an intra-abdominal volume of 12 021 ml. Pre-operative bowel preparation with Magcorol P reduced the volume of the hernia contents to 1604 ml, representing a 71% reduction. The intra-abdominal volume was decreased to 10 485 ml.\nThe TAPP procedure was performed under general anesthesia with the patient placed in a slight Trendelenburg position. In the aeroperitoneum, no adhesion between the orifice of the hernia and the abdominal content was identified. With four laparoscopic ports in place (Fig. ), the prolapsed intestine was slowly reduced by applying external pressure to the hernia from outside of the body. Following this procedure, complete reduction of the hernia contents was achieved, with an operative time of 2 h 50 min and a blood loss of approximately 700 ml. The loss of 700 ml of blood was mainly due to the injury caused by forceps when we sought to reduce the incarcerated omentum. We did not dissect the hernia sac, leaving it with the cord distally.\nCT imaging before hernia reduction indicated the diameter of the hernia orifice to be approximately 50 mm, with the posterior wall of the hernia orifice strengthened. A mesh of sufficient area was placed to cover the orifice of the hernia, completely detaching the dorsal aspect of the hernia from the peritoneal membrane up to the dorsal ileocecal region. Given the possibility of tearing of the peritoneal membrane, a VentralightTM ST mesh (Bard Davol Inc., RI, USA), 15 cm in diameter, was used.\nThe patient followed a satisfactory post-operative course. The scrotum on post-operative Day 2 is shown in Fig. . On post-operative Day 2, the patient complained of mild abdominal fullness, which disappeared by post-operative Day 4 (Fig. ). Ultrasonography of the lower limbs indicated absence of deep vein thrombophlebitis. The patient was discharged from the hospital on post-operative Day 12, with no recurrence of herniation, 12 months post-surgery (Fig. ).\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?\n\nIdeal Body Weight: IBW = base_weight + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60), where base_weight is 50 kg for men and 45.5 kg for women",

            "input": "In November 2007, a 49-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital from an orthopaedist complaining of a one year history of sustained difficulty walking and severe bilateral hip pain. Her height was 155.5 cm and body weight was 61.0 kg. Laboratory data showed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, potassium 2.8 mmol/l, calcium 9.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.5 mg/dl, uric acid 1.5 mg/dl, normoglycaemic glycosuria and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, HCO3− 17.4 mmol/l) (Table ). Bilateral transcervical fractures were confirmed by MRI (Fig. ) and bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot spots in her joints and ribs, compatible with osteomalacia (Fig. ). Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was diagnosed clinically from a low serum level of phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (11.0 pg/dl), high levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (67.5 IU/l), and the findings of bone scintigram, although a bone biopsy was not performed. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was ruled out by total body survey with whole body computed tomography or endoscopic surveillances and a normal blood FGF23 (22.1 pg/ml, 10–50 pg/ml) level.\nUrinalysis showed pH 6.0 and twenty four hour urine demonstrated a low renal fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Tmp/GFR 0.91), increased fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA 43.9 %) and generalized aminoaciduria.\nThe calculated anion gap was 12.4 meq/l, with an inappropriately alkaline urine (pH 6.0), suggestive of distal type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An intravenous bicarbonate loading test to assess the tubular dysfunction demonstrated that the increased fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FEHCO3− 13.25 %) and urine-blood (UB) Pco2 gradient (U-Bpco2 50.1 mmHg), suggesting the presence of proximal type of RTA. NH4Cl loading test was not performed because of the presence of apparent metabolic acidemia. These biochemical data of blood and urine indicated Fanconi syndrome with proximal type of RTA. Tests for anti-SSA and anti-SSB were negative and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Furthermore, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed no monoclonal component. Any of the patient’s medication did not seem to be related to Fanconi syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy demonstrated cellular infiltration of interstitium and proximal tubular epithelium composed mainly of CD3+ lymphocytes without glomerular involvement, consistent with features of TIN (Fig. ,).\nThe patient was also suspected to be diagnosed as PBC because of high levels of alkaline phosphatase (663 IU/l), high serum IgM levels (1084 mg/dl) and the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (1:10). Sequential liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of a periportal cellular infiltrate (Fig. ), compatible with PBC though biochemical liver function was normal. The combination of these findings led to the patient’s diagnosis of osteomalacia caused by TIN with Fanconi syndrome in asymptomatic PBC.\nThe patient was started on therapy with calcitriol (1 μg/day), neutral potassium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate (6 g/day). She was subsequently administered middle-dose corticosteroid (20 mg/day of predonisolone) and ursodeoxycholic acid (300 mg/day). One year after the treatment, the patient became asymptomatic and renal function remained stable. Furthermore, MRI showed the bilateral transcervical fractures of the femoral neck had almost fully repaired (Fig. ).

The patient had a history of heavy snoring, but was otherwise in good health. However, he had an extreme phobia of tooth extraction. The oral surgeon also determined that the procedure would be highly invasive; as a result, intravenous sedation was requested from the department of dental anesthesiology. We planned conscious sedation using dexmedetomidine to help secure the patient's airway during the extraction procedure. The authors also planned PCS for adequate titration of sedation levels. The patient received an explanation about the dental procedure under sedation, after which he provided written consents for the procedure and the case report.\nThe results of the pre-anesthesia examination performed the day before the surgery after the patient was admitted showed no specific findings, except eosinophil levels elevated to 13% in the blood test. He was given instruction for NPO for eight hours before the procedure and was sent to the operating room after securing an 18-gauge intravenous line in his left arm.\nThe PCS pump used was a Perfusor® Space PCA Infusion Pump System (B. Braun Medical Inc., Germany). Dexmedetomidine (Precedex 200 µg/2 ml) was diluted in normal saline to prepare a 50 ml solution at 4 µg/ml. Without setting a basal infusion dose in the PCS pump, the bolus dose, lock-out time, and injection speed were set to 0.1 µg/kg, 1 min, and 1,500 ml/h, respectively.\nElectrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and bispectral index (BIS) monitors were attached to the patient. The patient held the PCS demand button in one hand and the patient was instructed to push the button if he felt any anxiety or pain. Oxygen was supplied through a nasal canula, while capnography measurements were obtained simultaneously ().\nThe sedation procedure took a total of 100 min, and the procedure included saucerization of the region around #37 and extraction of impacted wisdom teeth (#18, 28, 38, and 48). The single dose administered when the patient pushed the button was 1.73 ml, equivalent to 6.93 µg. The patient pushed the button a total of 13 times, but was pushed four times within the lock-out time; therefore, the drug was actually administered nine times, totaling 15.6 ml (62.4 µg).\nThe patient maintained his state of consciousness and was able to respond to commands. His respiratory rate and vital signs also remained within a normal range (). During the operation, the button was pushed several times during painful procedures. Afterwards, the BIS value dropped to around 60 once, but was maintained around 90 throughout.

She had stopped all these medications except the contraceptive 12 months prior to her presentation. The patient has no history of alcohol abuse, thyroid dysfunction, or family history of HTG. On admission, all vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination was normal except for epigastric tenderness and a BMI of 31.4 kg/m2.\nThe initial relevant laboratory testing revealed sodium of 129 meq/l, potassium 3.7 meq/l, chloride 97 meq/l, BUN 10 mg/dl, creatinine 0.77 mg/dl (at baseline), bicarbonate 13.7 meq/l, anion gap 18 meq/l, glucose of 324 mg/dl, amylase 31 IU/l, lipase 206 IU/l, and TG 2,329 mg/dl with a previous baseline of around 2,000 mg/dl, serum calcium 9.0 mg/dl, TSH 1.182 µIU/ml, serum lactate 1.8 meq/l, negative urine ketones with serum beta-hydroxybutyrate 0.16 mmol/l, and negative urine pregnancy test. The abdominal computerized tomography scan showed no definite evidence of pancreatitis or any other pathology.\nDespite unremarkable imaging, normal amylase, mild elevation of lipase, and a TG level that was mildly elevated from previous baseline, she was treated for possible HTGP with IV insulin based on the overall clinical picture. The differential diagnosis includes diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); however, the patient lacked serum or urinary ketones. Regardless, IV insulin would treat both conditions of HTGP and DKA. The clinical impression of HTGP was further supported when her lipase increased to 370 IU/L and the TG levels on the initial sample was re-assayed resulting in a corrected reading of >10,000 mg/dl. The TG levels decreased to 6,069 mg/dl with IV insulin on day 5. However, given the worsening abdominal pain, plan for plasmapheresis to rapidly reduce the TG levels was taken.

The rash had progressed proximally from both feet to his thighs, upper extremities and abdomen over the past two weeks. He complained of nausea, and vomiting for one day but denied hematemesis, melanotic stools, or arthralgia. His significant comorbidities included hypertension, untreated hepatitis C, and alcohol abuse. He took no medications.\nOn physical examination blood pressure was 105/62 mmHg, pulse was 84 beats/minute and regular, and temperature 37.7°C. The skin showed nontender, palpable purpuric lesions involving both upper and lower extremities and the abdominal wall. Lungs were clear to auscultation and the cardiovascular exam was unremarkable. On abdominal examination no organomegaly was appreciated. There was no pedal edema.\nLaboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 13.1 × 10³/mcL, hemoglobin 14.7 g/dL, hematocrit 42.9%, and platelet count of 234 × 10³/mcL. Serum chemistry showed sodium 136 mEq/L, potassium 4.2 mEq/L, chloride 101 mEq/L, bicarbonate 24 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 34 mg/dL and serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL. Liver function tests revealed a total bilirubin of 1.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, ALT 75 units/L, AST 93 units/L, alkaline phosphatase 75 units/L, total protein 7.6 g/dL and albumin 3.7 g/dL. Hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis C antibody were all positive. Urinalysis demonstrated trace hematuria and proteinuria. He was sent to the emergency room for further evaluation.\nOn admission the patient was started on intravenous fluids and additional tests were obtained. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and serum complements (C3 and C4) were normal and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and cryoglobulins were negative. The serum creatinine improved to 0.75 mg/dL on hydration alone. Two days later he complained of diffuse abdominal pain and dark stool followed by hematochezia. He remained afebrile with a blood pressure of 120/50 mmHg. On physical examination he had significant right upper abdominal quadrant and epigastric tenderness. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed that failed to reveal a lesion that could account for his symptoms. A biopsy of the stomach mucosa demonstrated mild chronic inflammation. Computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was next performed and showed marked thickening of the terminal ileum (). Abdominal pain intensified, and the patient became tachycardic and tachypneic with a leukocytosis of 23 × 10³/mcL, with deteriorating renal function (BUN 54 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL) and evolving acidosis (bicarbonate 17 mEq/L). An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed which revealed gangrenous bowel from the beginning of the ileum to the transverse colon. Small bowel resection (90 cm of ileum) and right hemicolectomy (including appendix which was involved) with end jejunostomy were performed.\nHistopathologic examination of the resected intestinal tissue demonstrated an extensive necrotizing vasculitis with IgA deposition characteristic of HSP (). Of particular note was the very widespread (perhaps 50%) involvement of medium sized vessels, particularly arteries, with extensive necrosis and secondary ischemic injury to the intestines. Small arteries, arterioles, and venules were also involved. Heavy granular IgA deposition was seen with no staining for IgG or IgM. Lesser amounts of C3 paralleled the IgA deposition.\nIntravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for three days was administered and then 30 mg every 12 hours. Postoperatively he continued to have an elevated white blood cell count and persistent fever, but his renal function improved. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen revealed persistent small bowel wall thickening. A second exploratory laparotomy was performed, but no additional ischemic bowel was identified. The patient was continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics and maintained on a ventilator due to respiratory failure. Eight days after the second laparotomy he developed severe lactic acidosis, right upper abdominal quadrant tenderness jaundice and worsening renal function. Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant showed findings compatible with portal vein thrombosis and cholelithiasis.

He was born to nonconsanguineous parents, the birth weight was 2.8 kg and he had normal early physical and mental milestones. He was able to stand and walk at 10 months, but within next few weeks he was unable to walk and stand even with support. A frontal bossing, potbelly appeared and there was a failure to gain height. He received calcitriol 0.25 μg on alternate days and elemental calcium 1 g /day, but showed no improvement.\nOn examination, he was irritable and blood pressure was 100/65 mmHg. He had no edema or pallor and anterior frontanelle was still open. He had classical features of rickets [] such as frontal bossing, widened epiphysis at wrist, rickety rosary, potbelly and bowlegs. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Anthropometry showed height 73 cm, (5th percentile), weight 9 kg (5th percentle), head circumference 48 cm (between 75 and 90th percentile).\nLaboratory evaluation showed the following: Urine albumin-trace, sugar-nil, microscopy-no sediments; Hemoglobin 12.3 g/dl, Blood urea 21 mg/dl, serum creatinine 0.3 mg/ dl, serum sodium 137 mEq/l, serum potassium 3.4 mEq/l, serum chloride 99 mEq/l, serum bicarbonate 22 mEq/l, serum calcium 8.9 mg/dl, serum phosphate 2.0 mg/ dl (normal values for children: 4.5-6.5 mg/ dl), serum alkaline phosphatase 3966 IU/l and serum intact PTH 26.5 pg/ml (normal: 10-54). Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.353, pCO2 27.0 mmHg, pO2 114.3 mmHg, HCO3 14.6 mmol/l and simultaneous urine pH was 8.0. X-ray of wrists showed fraying and splaying of metaphyses of distal ulna and radius, old healed fractures of distal shaft of radius. Ultrasound of abdomen showed normal sized kidneys with multiple hyperechoic foci within, suggestive of calcification []. X-ray of abdomen showed no evidence of calcification in the region of kidneys.\nA diagnosis of hypophosphatemic rickets was made and was evaluated further. The 24-h urine protein excretion was 542.8 mg/day, phosphate excretion was 437 mg/ day, β2-microglobulin excretion was 37.6 mg/ day (normal < 0.2 mg/day) and calcium excretion was 82.8 mg/day (9mg/kg/day). Examination of urine showed generalized aminoaciduria. A diagnosis of Dent's disease was made, since he met the following criteria: male gender, rickets, severe hypercalciuria (9 mg/ kg/ day), LWMP (β2-microglobulin), hypophosphatemia, phosphaturia and nephrocalcinosis.\nHe received potassium citrate (potassium citrate monohydrate 220 mg and citric acid monohydrate 67 mg per ml) 3 ml twice daily, calcitriol 0.25 μg on alternate days, hydrochlorothiazide 6.125 mg twice daily and sodium phosphate (Proctoclysis enema preparation; sodium dihydrogen phosphate 16%, sodium phosphate 6%, 1 ml contains approximately 50 mg of elemental phosphorus) 1 ml orally thrice daily. The dose of drugs was adjusted periodically to achieve targets. At one year, he was on sodium phosphate 1 ml five times daily, potassium citrate 4 ml thrice daily, calcitriol 0.25 μg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 6.125 mg twice daily. The details of anthropometric and biochemical measures before and after therapy are shown in . At one year, there was a marked improvement in his mobility; he was able to walk and run and the bony deformities had improved significantly. There was a gain in height and weight, serum phosphorus was near normal and serum alkaline phosphatase was reduced by 50%.\n\nWhat is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?\n\nAnion Gap: anion_gap = sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L))",

He also complained of numbness and a tingling sensation on the left lateral side of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot. At the time of referral, the left leg and foot were soft and non-tender. Only the right dorsalis pedis was pulsatile, but not on the left side. Pain in the left lateral lower leg and dorsum of foot was scored 3/10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. The Medical Research Council scale for weakness showed the following grades (right/left): hip extension 5/5, knee flexion 5/5, ankle dorsiflexion 5/1, and hallucis extension 5/1. He had no lower back pain and the straight leg raise reached 80° on both sides. A positive Tinel's sign behind the fibular neck on the left side was noted. In a nerve conduction study, there was no compound motor action potential in the left deep peroneal nerve on the left extensor digitorum brevis or tibialis anterior muscle recordings, and no evoked sensory nerve action potential in the left superficial peroneal nerve (). Needle electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous activity at rest and no motor unit action potential activity in the left tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and peroneus brevis muscles (). Computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed proximal occlusion of the left anterior tibial artery (ATA) () without any abnormal findings of the soft tissue. This led to a diagnosis of left common peroneal neuropathy due to occlusion of the left ATA. The patient was treated with oral warfarin.\nThe patient's medical history was reviewed. He did not have diabetes mellitus. He received a mitral valve replacement 5 years ago due to mitral stenosis, and echocardiography showed a moderate degree of aortic stenosis and regurgitation. In addition, he had complete atrioventricular block and valvular atrial fibrillation; and had a pacemaker inserted three years prior to referral. However, he had been prescribed only an antiplatelet agent because of a history of cerebellar intracranial hemorrhage 2 years previously.\nApproximately 4 weeks prior to referral, he visited another hospital suffering from chest pain, and received percutaneous coronary angiography which took about 30 minutes. After percutaneous coronary angiography, he received conservative care in a general ward, without any physical restrain or requirement for absolute bed rest. He could ambulate the ward with only minimal assistance. Some days later, he complained of left leg weakness and a brain CT was performed to rule out an acute brain lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was contraindicated because of the cardiac pacemaker. The brain CT showed a subacute ischemic lesion in the right posterior temporal region but it did not clinically correlate with the weakness. Although he complained of foot drop and paresthesia, there were no symptoms of anterior compartment syndrome such as tenderness, redness or swelling of low leg. No deep vein thrombosis or abnormal findings of soft tissues were found upon ultrasonography of the left leg. After improvement of the chest pain, he was discharged home. Two weeks later he was admitted to the cardiology department in the present hospital due to chest pain, and was referred to the rehabilitation department. After diagnosis of the left common peroneal neuropathy and improvement of the chest discomfort with conservative therapy, he was transferred and received rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.\nCreatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.\nHis chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.\nRenal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.\n\nWhat is the patient's MELDA Na score?\n\nMELD Na (UNOS/OPTN): MELD(i) = [0.957 x ln(Cr) + 0.378 x ln(bilirubin) + 1.120 x ln(INR) + 0.643].

He also had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and was undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer. He had never smoked and his family history was unremarkable. He became aware of dyspnea on exertion in the previous 2 months, and was admitted to our hospital because his condition worsened. UCG revealed that the LVEF had decreased sharply from 73 to 44% (New York Heart Association class III). In this case, the inflammatory response remained low and stable at C-reactive protein levels of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/dL until the second operation.\nHis height and weight were 170.0 cm and 64.4 kg, respectively. His blood pressure was 86/48 mmHg and heart rate was 70 bpm (normal sinus rhythm).

Chest radiography and CT revealed a CTR of 72% and severe calcified coronary arteries (Fig. ). UCG revealed poor left ventricular function (LVDd/Ds, 56/43 mm; LVEF, 44%; inferoposterior wall hypokinesis; and mild MR with RVP of 29 mmHg). Cineangiography 4 years ago had shown only 25% stenosis in the proximal LAD; at admission, it revealed 90% stenosis in the same proximal LAD, 99% stenosis in the proximal LCX, and 95% stenosis in the posterolateral branch (PL) of LCX (Fig. a, b). He had low blood pressure during dialysis and underwent emergency surgery (Euro II risk score 40.7%; STS risk score, 33.2%).\nWe performed a sternotomy similar to the one performed previously, and then performed CABG (LITA-LAD, and LITA-right internal thoracic artery [right internal thoracic artery, RITA-Diagonal branch-PL1-PL-2-PL3]). The duration of surgery and CPB was 514 and 172 min, respectively. The postoperative ventilator management was completed in 9 h.

The medical history of patient revealed that he was diagnosed as a hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier about 20 years earlier, but was lost to follow up. The patient was not a heavy drinker or smoker. There was no significant family history. On physical examination, a palpable and hard mass was noted in the right pelvic area. Hepatomegaly, liver masses, and ascites were absent. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 4,830/µL, hemoglobin 15.2 g/dL, platelets 138,000/µL, total protein 7.8 g/dL, albumin 4.4 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 31 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 35 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL, alkaline phosphate 98 IU/L, prothrombin time 14 second (INR 1.21), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 15.01 ng/mL, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) 864 mAU/mL. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were positive. Hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), HBV-DNA with polymerase chain reaction, and serological markers of hepatitis C were negative. He belonged to Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A.\nFor evaluation of the pelvic mass, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed. They demonstrated a 13×10 cm expansile mass that involved the right iliac bone (). The patient underwent an incisional biopsy with the impression of a malignant bone tumor. However, on pathological examination, the tumor was composed of polygonal cells with ample cytoplasm and trabecular pattern. In immunohistochemical stains, these tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar1), and glypican-3, which confirmed the diagnosis of HCC (). Tumor cells were negative for CD56, chromogranin A and synaptophysin, which are the markers of neuroendocrine differentiation. To find the primary focus, abdominal CT, MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) scans and angiography were performed. However, no tumor was found in the liver in these radiologic examinations.\nWe diagnosed this case as an isolated metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone without the presence of a primary cancer in the liver. Surgical resection of the tumor was recommended, but the patient refused an operation because of old age and the large size of the tumor. Instead, we decided to treat him with combined modalities. He started radiotherapy in the pelvic area with a total dose of 5,100 cGy in 17 fractions. One week after the end of radiotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed in the metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone via the right internal iliac artery (adriamycin 50 mg and 20 mL of lipiodol). Then, the patient was treated with five cycles of systemic chemotherapy based on 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, 1,000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3) and cisplatin (90 mg/m2 on day 2 every 4 weeks). After the completion of chemotherapy, the tumor became almost necrotic. The AFP and PIVKA-II levels decreased to the normal ranges (2.85 ng/mL and 28 mAU/mL, respectively). As the treatment resulted in near complete regression of the tumor, the patient underwent close follow-up without chemotherapy. However, 12 months after chemotherapy, a CT scan revealed multiple lung metastases in both lungs with increasing AFP and PIVKA-II levels (182 ng/mL and 38 mAU/mL, respectively). He was treated with two cycles of systemic chemotherapy with the same regimen (5-FU 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2 and 3 and cisplatin 90 mg/m2 on day 2). After two cycles of chemotherapy, the patient refused additional chemotherapy and we provided him with supportive care thereafter. Even though the lung metastases were newly developed, primary HCC had not been detected in the sequential radiological examinations, including abdominal CT and PET CT scans.\n\nWhat is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?\n\nFibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT)",

He had experienced a 2-kg weight loss over the last few days. His usual medications included aspirin 100 mg q24 h, atorvastatin 40 mg q24 h, and metformin 850 mg q8 h, which had been switched to dapagliflozin 20 days before, due to poor glycemic control, with HbA1c 12% (108 mmol/mol). His vital signs included a heart rate of 122 bpm, respiratory rate 33 rpm, blood pressure 142/70 mmHg, temperature 36.1°C, and body mass index 22.5 kg/m2. On physical examination, somnolence, dry skin and mucous membranes, a Kussmaul breathing pattern, and a capillary refill of 3 sec were observed.

The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block, and nonspecific repolarization abnormalities. Because of the right bundle branch block was not previously known, a new troponin test was performed six hours later with a peak value of 4.28 ng/mL. Treatment with crystalloids, continuous infusion of intravenous insulin, and administration of potassium and sodium bicarbonate were begun in the emergency room (ER). Due to a poor response over the first two hours, with the persistence of lactic acidosis, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where more aggressive rehydration with crystalloids was started, without further modifications of the original therapeutic plan.\nTwo days later, the patient was discharged from the ICU to the endocrinology ward. Because of his coronary risk factors and the elevated troponin on admission, a coronary angiography was performed, showing triple-vessel disease. Successful bypass surgery without extracorporeal circulation was performed a few days later, with internal mammary artery grafts to the anterior descendent and marginal obtuse arteries and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.

He had experienced a recurrent history of anxiety and mild somatic symptoms for the past five years. He reported sleeping difficulties, panic attacks, ruminative worries, muscle tension, body weakness, and chest discomfort. The patient had a prior psychiatric history and hospitalization for anxiety and depression. He had been admitted for anxiety and depression in a free-standing health facility five years ago and had been treated with medications. He had been prescribed sertraline and quetiapine but had self-discontinued because of tolerability issues. He had continued to be anxious with mild somatic symptoms. The patient denied any manic or psychotic symptoms or any neurological symptoms. The patient also denied any suicidal or homicidal ideations. He had no history of substance use or alcohol intake. He had a family history of anxiety disorder, described as an obsessive-compulsive disorder in his mother. In 2019, he had consulted a physician who had performed an extensive medical workup. All test results were unremarkable; he was reassured and his symptoms improved. During the two to three weeks prior to the current presentation, his anxiety and somatic symptoms had recurred and had subsequently worsened. He was then admitted for further investigation.\nExamination\nThe mental status examination revealed a young man who was neat and well-groomed. He was cooperative, calm, and made appropriate eye contact. His speech was normal. He described his mood as anxious and his affect was constricted. His thought process was normal and linear. There was no suicidal or homicidal ideation. No delusions or hallucinations were reported. He was awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, people, and events. His judgment and insight were fair.\nInvestigation\nHe underwent a 12-lead electrocardiogram, which showed a ventricular rate of 80 beats/minute (reference range: 60-100 beats/minute), atrial rate of 80 beats/minute (reference range: 60-100 beats/minute), PR interval of 148 milliseconds (reference range: 120-200 milliseconds), QRS duration of 94 milliseconds (reference range: 80-100 milliseconds), QT interval of 350 milliseconds (reference range: 360-430 milliseconds), and QTC calculation (Bazett) of 403 milliseconds (reference range: ≤440 milliseconds) with normal sinus rhythm.\nOther medical workups done revealed thyroid-stimulating hormone of 2.398 uIU/mL (reference range: 0.35-5.5 uIU/mL), hemoglobin A1c of 5.6% (reference range: <5.7%), and urinalysis showing no ketones or proteins. Lipid profile showed cholesterol of 182 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: <200 milligrams per deciliter), high-density lipoprotein of 39 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: <40 milligrams per deciliter), low-density lipoproteins of 103.8 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: <100 milligrams per deciliter), and a slightly elevated triglyceride of 196 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: <150 milligrams per deciliter). His basic metabolic panel was as follows: sodium of 140 millimoles per liter (reference range: 136-145 millimoles per liter), potassium of 4.1 millimoles per liter (reference range: 3.6-5.2 millimoles per liter), chloride of 104 millimoles per liter (reference range: 98-106 millimoles per liter), glucose of 93 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 70-100 milligrams per deciliter), calcium of 9.3 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 8.5-10.5 milligrams per deciliter), phosphorus of 4.0 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 3.4-4.5 milligrams per deciliter), blood urea nitrogen of 9 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 7-20 milligrams per deciliter), and creatinine of 1.0 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 0.84-1.21 milligrams per deciliter).

He complained also of chronic generalized weakness and fatigue. He denied nausea or vomiting, but did have occasional loose stools. The hypokalemia persisted despite discontinuation of diuretic treatment for hypertension and fludrocortisone that had been prescribed briefly for orthostatic hypotension. There was no improvement with aggressive oral potassium supplementation in amounts up to 120 meq per day. The patient's serum potassium level normalized on three occasions when he was hospitalized and given supplemental potassium (COPD exacerbations in 7/06 and 1/07, pseudoseizures in 7/07), but the hypokalemia promptly recurred after discharge from the hospital (Figure ).

Due to the combination of hypoxemia and abnormal electrocardiograph (ECG) findings, she was advised to transfer to our hospital; the patient did not receive prenatal obstetric care in our hospital. The admitting diagnosis was cardiac insufficiency, cyanotic CHD (dubious) and scarred uterus. The physical examination revealed blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, a pulse of 90/min, a respiratory rate of 25/min, slightly cyanotic lips and the same on her cheeks, coarse breath sounds to auscultation in the lungs, and a regular heartbeat. A loud P2 and grade 3/6 systolic murmur was heard at the third and fourth ribs on the left edge of the sternum. The ECG showed sinus rhythm, complete right bundle branch block (CRBBB), first degree A-V block, inverted T wave, right ventricular hypertrophy, and severe cardiac clockwise rotation.\nThe obstetricians felt that the manifestations of cardiac insufficiency in the mother put her at high risk in a vaginal delivery. The fetus presented with abnormal heart rate variability, with no further evidence that the fetus was in a state of emergency. Considering that the mother had been in a condition of hypoxia, which would result in hypoxia in the baby, the obstetricians recommended emergency cesarean section for the benefit of both the mother and the baby.\nThe patient was transferred to the operating theater with a temperature of 36.8 °C, a heart rate of 92 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 23breaths/min, a blood pressure of 138/88 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 83-90% in air. With the administration of a fractional inspired concentration of oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 to 0.6 via a Venturi mask, the patient’s oxygen saturation increased from 88 to 92%. Peripheral venous access was sited, and a 400-ml bolus of compound sodium chloride was commenced, after which a radial arterial line was placed under local anesthesia for beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring.\nCombined spinal-epidural anesthesia (single-shot spinal anesthesia) was administered in this case. The puncture point of spinal anesthesia was selected in the L2-3 interspace, and the procedure was performed using a needle-through-needle technique in the left lateral decubitus position. After cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be slowly aspirated through the needle, doses of 1.4 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine made up with 10% glucose for a hyperbaric solution that made it easy to adjust and control the anesthetic plane were injected into the subarachnoid space slowly towards the head, and an epidural catheter was inserted into the epidural space. The patient was then placed in the supine position with a left lateral tilt of at least 30 degrees; [] the patient’s abdomen could be raised softly if necessary to relieve vena caval compression. Within 20 min later of the anesthetic injection, we tested the block height every 1-2 min and adjusted the head-up or head-down tilt position to strictly control the blockade under the level of T6-8. Twenty minutes later, the level of spinal block was static at T8. One minute later, the patient was returned to the supine position, with a slight decrease arterial pressure to 122/82 mmHg and a heart rate of 97 beats/min. As small doses of metaraminol could resist the vasodilatation caused by anesthesia to maintain the afterload, 100 μg of metaraminol was administered, after which the patient’s arterial pressure increased to 130/84 mmHg, with a heart rate of 91 beats/min.\nDuring the entire procedure, the key for safely administering anesthesia on such a patient was to keep her blood pressure stable and to carefully address the side effects of the changes in the hemodynamics []. Because the spinal anesthesia took action faster and due to the rapid sympathectomy in the intra-vertebral anesthesia, great care should be taken of the changes in arterial pressure and heart rate after puncture and injection.\nA male baby was smoothly delivered 10 min after the surgery began; the baby had Apgar scores of 8 at 1 min and 9 at 5 min. In addition to the caution that must be paid due to the change in the patient’s venous return at the time of the delivery of the baby, some factors need to be given attention to avoid the occurrence of great amounts of intra-cardiac shunt changes and even heart failure. First, because the oppression of the inferior vena cava was relieved after childbirth, the lower limb venous blood flow increased rapidly, and the venous return increased in a short amount of time as a result. Abdominal sandbags were adopted to add pressure to reduce the returned blood volume. Further, the maternal “autologous blood transfusion effect” had to be considered: after the fetus was delivered, the myometrium contracted, and intrauterine blood flowed back to the blood vessels rapidly, thereby increasing the cardiac preload in a short amount of time. If the initial transfusion was too great, it could lead to heart failure. According to the patient’s fluctuations in blood pressure, a bolus of ephedrine 3 mg or metaraminol 100 μg was used to restore the blood pressure to 130 ~ 140/82 ~ 87 mmHg, with a heart rate of 90 ~ 98 beats/min and an SpO2 of 89 ~ 93% during the surgery. The goal was to balance the preload and afterload and to try to maintain the intra-cardiac shunt in the preoperative level of stability.\nUterine atony was noted by the surgeon after delivery of the placenta. Oxytocin is usually administered to increase the contractions so as to reduce bleeding; however, a rapid infusion of oxytocin could increase the patient’s heart rate, reduce the cardiac output and coronary blood flow, and break the balance of the intra-cardiac shunt, which could lead to cardiac insufficiency. Therefore, the application of oxytocin must begin with small doses, and the dosage should be adjusted over time. Thus, oxytocin (10 mIU/min) was intravenously infused, and the infusion was adjusted in accordance with the patient’s changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Continuous post-cesarean analgesia was provided through an epidural catheter. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was then sent to the ward in stable condition the following day.\nWe advised the patient to have an echocardiogram examination, which revealed CHD, a single atrium, and defects of the endocardial cushions (Fig. ). Thus, we made a complementary diagnosis of CHD: single atrium. The patient was in good condition at the 6-month follow-up.\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

However, the leading symptom on presentation was watery diarrhea for 3 weeks.\nThe patient was accompanied by his father who reported that his son suffered from cachexia starting age 17. Prior to age 17, his medical history was unremarkable. His parents and 7 siblings are all healthy.\nAt the time of initial symptom onset, the patent lived in the Simanjiro district for cattle herding, while the rest of his family members lived in the suburban area of Arusha. He reported several insect bites during his period of working as a cattle herder. His symptoms gradually worsened with increasing weight loss and splenomegaly and as well as skin rashes and maculae in his face. After a year, he sought treatment from traditional healers. After another year of no improvement from consultation of the traditional healer, he presented to an outside hospital in the Arusha region (unknown diagnostic and treatment approach). Eventually, he was admitted at KCMC for further diagnostics.\nOn admission to KCMC, the patient’s primary complaints were abdominal pain and swelling. The laboratory tests on admission revealed white blood count of 1.51 × 109/L (neutrophils 37.3%, lymphocytes 58.4%, monocytes 3.7%, eosinophils 0.4%, and basophils 0.2%), red blood cell count 2.21 × 1012/L, hemoglobin 4.9 g/dL, thrombocytes 56 × 109/L, creatinine 41 μmol/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 12.9 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 7.6 U/L, sodium 124.6 mmol/L, potassium 2.9 mmol/L, and chloride 106 mmol/L. HIV test result is negative. The sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for tuberculosis (GenXpert, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California, United States of America) was negative; a chest X-ray investigation was normal; and ultrasound of the abdomen revealed hepatosplenomegaly.\nOn physical exam, he appeared pale and was wasted with a body weight of 39 kg and a height of 172 cm. On abdominal exam, his spleen was enlarged 18 cm below costal margin; the liver was enlarged 3 cm below costal margin; there were traditional healer marks throughout the abdomen; there were no palpable lymph nodes; and the lungs and heart were normal. His skin exam demonstrated hypopigmented maculae scattered on his face with accentuation in the perioral region () and skin-colored maculae on his trunk and arms. The latter occurred a few months before presentation in the hospital. Alopecia areata was also noted.\nHis travel history includes a 3-month stay in Mombasa (Kenya), approximately 1 year prior to presentation, where he worked as a merchant. Travels to other areas in Kenya or other countries, especially to endemic VL areas, has been denied by the patient as well as travels within Tanzania.\nDue to pancytopenia, the patient was referred to the Hematology section of the Cancer Care Centre at KCMC, where we performed bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, revealing Leishmania amastigotes in macrophages (Figs and ). The rapid test for Leishmania antibody detection (IT LEISH) from the peripheral blood and the bone marrow aspirate remained negative.\nAfter discussion with senior experts in tropical diseases, we decided to reperform bone marrow aspiration for PCR in a reference laboratory, which found the aspirate positive for Leishmania species DNA.\nDue to the unavailability of liposomal Amphotericin, we initiated treatment with Amphotericin B (1 mg/kg IV). Unfortunately, the patient passed away on the fourth day of treatment due to sudden onset of respiratory insufficiency. Beside evidence of massive organ manifestations of VL (Figs –), the autopsy revealed pneumonia ().\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

Her past medical history was depression, and she has been taking duloxetine, a SNRI 60 mg/day (in the morning) and mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) 30 mg/day at bedtime for 1 year. Her mental status was stable and these medications was continued until the day of the surgery.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol, remifentanil, rocuronium, and maintained with propofol and remifentanil. Blood pressure and heart rate were stable during anesthesia, and fentanyl 200 μg and flurbiprofen 50 mg along with local infiltration of 0.75% ropivacaine 6.4 ml was administered for postoperative analgesia at the end of the surgery. The duration of the surgery and anesthesia were 80 and 123 min, respectively. She emerged from general anesthesia with no abnormal symptoms. As the surgery was performed in the evening, she skipped to take mirtazapine on the day of the surgery.\nOne day after the surgery, the patient took the usual dose of duloxetine 60 mg in the morning. Three to 5 min later, she claimed hot flush, stiffness around her neck and shoulders, and muscle rigidity in the masseter. The blood pressure was 112/78 mmHg, and the heart rate was 77 beats/min at this time. Medical examination showed neuromuscular abnormalities (muscle rigidity, myoclonus, stiff neck, tremor, and hyperreflexia) and autonomic instability (diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, and mydriasis). Myoclonus seizure had appeared intermittently and repeated mainly on the upper extremities and neck. During the myoclonus seizure, her heart rate and systolic blood pressure had raised to 140 beats/min and over 160 mmHg, respectively. The respiratory rate also raised to 28–35/min. She was febrile (37.4 °C) and complained of anxiety due to the situation occurring to her. Given the neuromuscular abnormalities and recent surgery, malignant syndrome and neuroleptic malignant hyperthermia were assumed and initial dose of dantrolene 40 mg was given immediately, and body cooling was started as well. Blood test revealed no abnormalities including creatine kinase level, thyroid hormone, glucose, and electrolytes. Dantrolene was not effective and anesthesiologists were consulted from the gynecologists for further treatment.\nA diagnosis of serotonin syndrome was made based on the findings that the onset of the symptoms occurred immediately after taking SNRI; symptoms such as clonus, agitation, hypertension, and tachycardia corresponded to the diagnostic criteria (Hunter criteria; Table ) []. Duloxetine and mirtazapine were stopped. Serum levels of serotonin was 4 (normal range 57–230) ng/ml, dopamine 21 (<20) pg/ml, noradrenaline 434 (100–450) pg/ml, and adrenaline 294 (<100) pg/ml. Myoclonus seizures occurred repeatedly, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension persisted, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nClonazepam 1.0 mg (per oral) was given orally for anxiety and hyperexcitatory symptoms, and intravenous landiolol 0.01 mg/kg/min was started to control heart rate. Non-selective serotonin receptor antagonist, cyproheptadine (per oral, 12 mg), was also initiated to decrease intrasynaptic serotonin level through 5-HT blocking effect. Myoclonus had disappeared soon after administration of cyproheptadine and hemodynamic had stabilized. Intralipid (20%) 100 ml was also administrated for its transient ability to draw tissue and receptor bound serotonergic drugs into lipid-expanded intravascular compartment and trap them into a lipid phase. Additional cyproheptadine 4 mg was given 6 h later and 14 h later from its first administration to continue its antagonistic effect. Two days after surgery, the patient was transferred to the general ward. Serum serotonin effect site concentration was 3 ng/ml. Four days after the surgery, the patient was discharged from the hospital and advised to consult her psychiatrist for the further use of SNRI and NaSSA.

Symptoms were not alleviated or exacerbated by any specific factors. The patient had purchased a Cerbera odollam plant on the internet a week prior. She ingested one seed of this plant, as this was suggested to be the lethal dose, with the intent of ending her life. The exact time between ingestion and presentation was unknown. On transportation to the hospital, the patient had a documented heart rate in the 30s with a junctional rhythm and therefore received a total of 10 vials of Digibind (digoxin immune fab). She denied any headache, visual disturbances, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, abdominal tenderness, diarrhea, or constipation.\nOn presentation, the patient's vital signs were blood pressure of 105/74 mmHg, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, body temperature at 98.6 degrees F, and oxygen level of 98% on room air. Physical examination was noted as within normal limits.

This demonstrated a significant decrease in heart rate as compared to presenting vital signs. The heart rate had decreased from 106 beats per minute to 36 beats per minute (). Therefore, the patient was monitored on telemetry, and repeat ECGs were ordered. Her heart rate remained in the 30s to 40s, and the rhythm was sinus bradycardia. Upon consultation, the toxicology team recommended to monitor electrolytes and heart rate closely while continuing intravenous fluids. If there were any conduction blocks or further slowing of heart rate, 5 more vials of Digibind could be given. She had a hypoglycemic episode with blood glucose of 60 mg/dL. She was administered dextrose and responded appropriately.\nThe following day, the psychiatry team was consulted, and the patient was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and depressive disorder and noted to have narcissistic and borderline personality traits. The patient met the criteria for inpatient psychiatric hospitalization once medically cleared.\nThe toxicology team continued to follow the patient during her hospitalization. Being that her digoxin level was only 0.2 ng/mL and she had normalized potassium levels, her likelihood for toxicity was low.

Ureteroscopy and biopsy revealed a low grade urothelial tumor in the renal pelvis. In April 2016 he underwent a robotic assisted left nephroureterectomy. The pathology indicated high grade pT3 urothelial cancer in the renal pelvis with small HG Ta and CIS in the ureter. There was Ta tumor at the distal margin. Adjuvant chemotherapy was discussed but was not given because of his renal failure. Subsequent serial imaging has been negative for any metastasis.\nBeginning in July 2016 he has developed multifocal low or high grade Ta urothelial cancer of the bladder.

After establishing standard monitors [electrocardiogram (ECG), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), SpO2, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2)], Injection ranitidine 2.5 mg, metoclopromide 0.3 mg, dexamethasone 1.2 mg, and fentanyl 4 mcg were administered intravenously. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane 4% in oxygen and ventilation assisted. Patient’s spontaneous respiratory efforts were maintained for dynamic assessment of tracheomalacia. A neonatal flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (size 2.2 mm) was introduced through the tracheal tube. Oxygen was connected to the bronchoscope. The tracheal tube was then withdrawn over the bronchoscope to allow for assessment of trachea. The anterior tracheal wall near carina was seen to collapse with inspiration. Following assessment, the tracheal tube was reinserted into the trachea by railroading over the bronchoscope. Injection atracurium 1.2 mg was given and positive pressure ventilation started. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2% in oxygen and Injection atracurium intermittent boluses. Left anterior third intercostal space thoracotomy was done. During dissection, the patient had an episode of hypotension and bradycardia (up to 70/min). Surgeons were requested to immediately relieve compression of the major vessels. A fluid bolus and Injection atropine 0.1 mg were administered. Heart rate and blood pressure returned to normal and surgery was resumed. After the surgical procedure was complete, neuromuscular block was reversed with Injection glycopyrolate 0.02 mg and Injection neostigmine 0.15 mg intravenously. sevoflurane 2% in oxygen was continued. Bronchoscope was re-inserted through the tracheal tube. The anterior tracheal wall no longer collapsed with inspiration. Intercostal and substernal retractions were also absent. Morphine 0.06 mg via caudal route and paracetamol suppository 80 mg were given for postoperative analgesia. Recovery from anesthesia was smooth. Trachea was extubated and patient was able to breathe normally.

She also had experienced multiple episodes of non-bloody vomitus during the previous 24 hours. One year earlier, she was diagnosed with uncontrolled T2DM but refused to start insulin treatment. Two months before presentation, her hemoglobin A1C concentration was 12%, and she was started on treatment with a combination of dapagliflozin and metformin.\nAt the time of presentation to the emergency department, the patient was afebrile with a mild increase in blood pressure to 138/86 mmHg. She was also tachypneic and tachycardiac, with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/minute, a regular pulse with a heart rate of 116 beats/minute, and normal oxygen saturation. Her weight was 99 kg and her height was 179 cm with a body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed an obese dehydrated woman in mild distress and with mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, but no other remarkable findings. Her blood glucose concentration on Accu-check was 252 mg/dl. Laboratory testing showed an initial blood glucose concentration of 268 mg/dl, an anion gap of 18 mmol/l, and a pH of venous blood gases of 7.18. In addition, her bicarbonate concentration was 9 mmol/dl, her blood urea nitrogen was 50 mg/dl with creatinine 1.7 mg/dl, her acetone was elevated, and her hemoglobin A1C was 14.3%. Urinalysis showed moderate ketones with + 3 glucose. Her beta-human chorionic gonadotropin concentration and septic workup were negative, her cardiac enzymes were normal, and electrocardiography showed no signs of ischemia.\nFollowing confirmation of DKA, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and administered two liters of normal saline. Accu-check one hour later showed a blood glucose level of 55 mg/dl, a finding confirmed by a serum blood glucose concentration of 68 mg/dl, a significant reduction from the initial concentration of 268 mg/dl. The patient was administered 50 ml of a 50% dextrose solution; once her blood glucose stabilized, she was started on continuous insulin infusion along with the dextrose-containing intravenous solution. She was not treated with the dapagliflozin- metformin combination while in hospital. Her acidosis and anion gap were corrected over the following three days; because her hemoglobin A1C level remained elevated, she was discharged on the insulin regimen.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

            "input": "A 40-year-old para four obese Caucasian woman with two-year history of lower abdominal pain was referred from a peripheral hospital for the further management of bilateral adnexal masses. The computerised tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed a complex cystic lesion of 7–8 cm in the right adnexum and bilateral ureteric obstruction. All baseline blood tests including haematology and tumour markers (CA 125 -26 IU/ml) were normal. The serum tests showed normal liver function and moderately impaired renal function (creatinine 10–15, urea > 200).\nShe had a complex medical history including obstructive sleep apnoea, asthma, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, hypertensive cardiomyopathy and bipolar disorder; registered disabled. She also had a copper intra uterine contraceptive device in situ for the past three years. Given her body habitus (BMI 42), abdominal and pelvic examination was difficult and non-specific. The only finding of relevance was bilateral adnexal fullness.\nShe was managed within the gynaecological oncology multi disciplinary framework (MDT). On reviewing the CT films the features noted include bilateral basal pleural thickening, bilateral hydronephrosis, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis and bilateral adnexal cystic masses. There was a small volume of ascites.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for further characterisation of the adnexal masses. The right adnexal complex cystic lesion measured 8 × 7 × 7 cm in diameter and had a thick wall (up to 2 cm), which was irregular. There were several septations, some of which measured 3 – 4 mm. There were no enhancing papillary formations, although the wall and septa enhanced. The appearance suggested an ovarian lesion with possible involvement of the Fallopian tube. The left adnexal cyst measured 5 × 6 × 4 cm, had a smooth wall and contained a single thin septation, consistent with a benign ovarian cyst. Both cysts contained fluid, which was low on T1 and high on T2, with no evidence of fat or blood. Surrounding the cysts posteriorly, the fat was streaky in appearance and there was marked thickening of the adjacent fascial planes, with thickening of the mesorectal fascia up to 1 cm. The fascial thickening extended up the pre-sacral space and along the posterior aspect of the pelvic sidewalls, resulting in the obstruction of the ureters. Enlarged lymph nodes (up to 1.8 cm in short axis) were present along both pelvic sidewalls, which were striking due to the very high T2 signal intensity (Figure ). Nodes were also seen in the inguinal and para-aortic regions. Although the imaging appearances could not rule out an ovarian neoplasm, the features noted above were suggestive of an inflammatory process. In view of the woman's medical history and clinical status the MDT recommendation was clinical review and imaging guided biopsy of lymph nodes.\nThe woman underwent CT guided right inter iliac node biopsy, following an unyielding biopsy of inguinal nodes. Histology revealed non-caseating granulomatous lymphadenitis with negative stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi. There was no foreign body seen. Given the histological findings our attention was directed towards an inflammatory process. She was subsequently referred to respiratory physicians, with a working diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She was also referred to urologists for the management of retroperitoneal fibrosis and bilateral hydronephrosis. Abdominal pain prompted insertion of bilateral JJ ureteric stents. The physicians initiated a (step-down) course of prednisolone. Symptomatic improvement was observed but the renal function did not change. Repeat imaging demonstrated resolution of hydronephrosis.\nThe woman was reviewed again clinically after the course of steroids. During this interval the physicians ordered an autoantibody screen as autoimmune disease can co-exist with sarcoidosis; the screen was negative (Rheumatoid factor, anti-DNA antibody and antinuclear antibody). On examination there was no evidence of any palpable lymphadenopathy. An ultra sonographic examination six months later demonstrated a bulky uterus and reduction in the size of the right adnexal cyst. Repeat imaging (MRI axial T2W image) a further two months later demonstrated resolution of the left adnexal cyst. There was a small residual cyst on the right and marked decrease in the thickening of the mesorectal fascia. The lymph nodes appeared normal (Fig ). The retroperitoneal fibrosis on imaging had resolved. Her CA125 remained normal.

            "input": "A 12-year-old boy who experienced a cardiac arrest was referred to our emergency department from a local hospital in January 2020. His medical history revealed a cardiac fibroma that was detected prenatally. After birth, the fibroma was partially resected twice at another hospital, as the size and extent of the tumor prohibited single-stage resection. Heart transplantation was considered at the time. At the age of 2 years, he experienced cardiac arrest and was admitted to the same hospital. At that time, ventricular tachycardia was repeatedly detected. He developed central nervous system complications, including hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and quadriplegia, after which he had received oral amiodarone. Later, hydrocephalus was detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and he was treated with a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.\nThe patient’s medication was discretionally discontinued at 10 years of age. At 12 years of age, he experienced a cyanotic spell at home and was unable to breathe. He received cardiopulmonary resuscitation from his father. When the rescue squad arrived, they determined that he was in ventricular fibrillation. Defibrillation was performed, and sinus rhythm was restored. The boy was transported to a local hospital where he received endotracheal intubation. Thereafter, he was referred to our hospital, where he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.\nOn admission, the patient’s blood pressure and heart rate were 115/70 mm Hg and 151 beats per minute, respectively. He was intubated and was in a stuporous state. Cardiac murmurs were not heard on chest auscultation. Venous blood gas analysis revealed pH, 7.22; pCO2, 58 mm Hg; pO2, 28 mm Hg; HCO3, 18.9 mmol/L; and SvO2, 39%. Serum biochemical analysis showed a lactate level of 9.25 mmol/L. The levels of serum electrolytes were as follows: sodium, 142 mEq/L; potassium, 3.6 mEq/L; chloride, 109 mEq/L; total calcium, 8.4 mEq/L; ionized calcium, 2.3 mEq/L; inorganic phosphorous, 4.0 mg/dL; and magnesium, 1.7 mg/dL. Serum cardiac enzyme levels were as follows: creatine kinase, 155 IU/L; creatine kinase-MB, 3.37 ng/mL; troponin-T, 0.137 ng/mL; and pro-brain natriuretic peptide, 85.9 pg/ml. Cardiomegaly was observed on chest radiography (). Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with intermittent monomorphic ventricular premature contractions (VPCs). On the 1st day of hospitalization, the patient was supported by mechanical ventilation, without an intravenous inotropic agent. On the 2nd day, VPCs preceded abrupt ventricular fibrillation. He was resuscitated with sinus rhythm restoration following cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation (2 J/kg). Transthoracic echocardiography () and cardiac computed tomography () demonstrated a known fibroma (about 9.5 cm × 5.5 cm) in the anteroseptal wall of the left ventricle without blood flow obstruction. Soon after, he developed ventricular tachycardia (), and direct current cardioversion was performed along with intravenous amiodarone administration. Additionally, intravenous dopamine was administered for hypotension management. From the third to 9th days of hospitalization, he experience recurrent ventricular tachycardia refractory to multiple (45 times) direct current cardioversions (2 to 4 J/kg) and aggressive administration of antiarrhythmic agents (intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine). Although we suspected that the fibroma induced the arrhythmia, we believed additional partial resection of the tumor would not prevent it. Further, the patient’s poor neurocognitive and psychomotor states posed additional considerations for management. On the 10th day of hospitalization, he underwent an electrophysiology study, and a single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) generator (Visia AF MRI XT VR SureScan; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with a lead (model 6935M-62cm, Medtronic) attached to the right ventricle was inserted (). On the 11th day, weaning from mechanical ventilation was initiated. Additionally, the intravenous antiarrhythmic agents were discontinued, and oral amiodarone (10 mg/kg/day) and propranolol (0.75 mg/kg/day) were prescribed. On the 18th day, in the absence of an episode of ventricular arrhythmia from ICD memory for five days, he was discharged in stable condition with the ICD generator and followed up in the outpatient clinic.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?\n\nDelta Gap: delta_gap = anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12",

Her preoperative electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and laboratory parameters were within the normal range.\nIn the operating room, the patient’s blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg, heart rate was 80 beats/minute, and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 98%. The left internal jugular vein and left radial artery were accessed for monitoring. Standard induction was performed. The ventilation mode was volume-controlled ventilation with a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths/minute, and inspired oxygen fraction of 50% with no positive end-expiratory pressure. The patient was then placed in the left lateral recumbent position. Her PETCO2 before the introduction of CO2 pneumoperitoneum was 37 mmHg, and her SpO2 was 100%.\nTEE (Vivid E95; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) examination revealed no abnormality. Trocars were placed in the abdominal cavity at three sites (the navel, the subcostal margin at the midline of the clavicle, and the intersection of the anterior axillary line and level of the navel). The CO2 pneumoperitoneum was established at a pressure of 15 mmHg. Ten minutes after the introduction of CO2 pneumoperitoneum, while the surgeons were dissecting the perirenal fat without significant bleeding, TEE showed a sudden increase in small gas bubbles in the RA and small bubbles in the RV. The patient was immediately placed in the Trendelenburg position. About 8 minutes later, TEE showed a large amount of gas bubbles in the left atrium, left ventricle, ascending aorta, and pulmonary artery (). At the same time, the PETCO2 began to fall to 20 mmHg from 37 mmHg, and this decrease lasted for 20 minutes. There were no changes in the patient’s pulse, blood pressure, SpO2, or electrocardiogram parameters.\nWe quickly increased the fraction of inspired oxygen to 100%. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.27, arterial oxygen pressure of 161 mmHg, arterial CO2 pressure of 65 mmHg, and lactic acid concentration of 2.4 mmol/L. After communication with the surgeon, the pneumoperitoneum pressure was reduced to 10 mmHg. Meanwhile, gas bubbles could still be seen in the whole heart, the hepatic vein, and the IVC (). There was no regional wall motion abnormality, and the RV was normal. Color ultrasonography showed no defect in the atrial septum or ventricular septum and no patent foramen ovale (PFO).\nNine hours after the operation, the patient exhibited slurred speech and developed an epileptiform seizure in the ward. After the seizure, the muscle strength of both limbs was weakened. The blood myoglobin and lactic acid concentrations were increased. However, a computed tomography scan showed no obvious infarction or hemorrhage.

By day three, moderate induration had developed, there were no signs of improvement, and the intensity of pain worsened. CT scan of both lower extremities was not consistent with necrotizing fasciitis and repeat labs showed a white count 15,700, with 75% neutrophils, and C-reactive protein 48 mg/dl, calcium 9.76 mg/dl, phosphorus 12.5 mg/dl (first time obtained). He required a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump to control his pain with little improvement. His antibiotics were changed to linezolid, tobramycin, and levofloxacin. On the fourth day, there was an increased induration of the thighs with rock hard consistency of the tissue. Skin biopsy was performed showing deposition of calcium in the small blood vessels of the skin, areas of fat necrosis with foamy histiocytes, and neutrophils consistent with calciphylaxis (Figures -). Parathyroid hormone level (PTH) was 628 pg/ml.\nHe received daily dialysis with intravenous sodium thiosulfate given post dialysis for three days. His calcium-containing phosphate binders and paricalcitol were stopped; dosage was increased for sevelamer and lanthanum carbonate, another phosphate binder, was added to lower phosphorus levels. The patient’s pain, redness, swelling and induration improved over the next three days and his calcium was 8.5 gm/dl and phosphorus 7.3 mg/dl at the time of discharge.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nCKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate: GFR = 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coefficient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

He gave no history of cough, expectoration, hemoptysis and dyspnea or weight loss. He had no history of alcohol drinking or cigarette smoking. He denied any history of unprotected sexual contact or drug abuse. He had a blood transfusion 18 years ago following a road traffic accident. He was started on pegylated interferon alpha therapy 20 weeks prior to his presentation as well as ribavirin treatment for his hepatitis C.\nOn physical examination, he was a well-developed gentleman with no cardiorespiratory distress, but looked confused. His vital signs were stable. His abdominal examination was soft, lax with no tenderness or organomegaly. His cardiorespiratory examination was normal. He had no lymphadenopathy and central nervous system examination was intact grossly with negative meningeal signs.\nHis blood investigations revealed normal complete blood count, renal function tests and blood glucose. He had normal lactate and lipase level. His transaminases were mildly elevated. His calcium level was 15.2 mg/dl with albumin level of 3.5 gm/dl. His parathyroid hormone level (PTH) was appropriately suppressed []. He was managed by the emergency physician with aggressive normal saline hydration, intravenous pamidronate and hydrocortisone.\nEndocrinology service was consulted and impression of non-parathyroid hormone related hypercalcemia was suggested. His work-up showed bilateral hilar opacity on chest X-ray, which was confirmed by a computerized scan of the chest showing bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. His mediastinal lymph node biopsy showed non-caseating granuloma consistent with sarcoidosis.\nDuring his hospital stay, his mental status improved and his calcium level returned to normal level within 30 days. He was managed with 0.9% normal saline hydration, and furosemide with cessation of his hepatitis C therapy []. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis with severe hypercalcemia induced by interferon therapy was made. This is based on clinical, biochemical, radiological and histopathological criteria. The CT scan of his chest was repeated two months later and showed complete resolution of the hilar lymphadenopathy without the use of steroid, which confirmed this association.\nThis case describes symptomatic hypercalcemia as the initial presenting feature of interferon-induced sarcoidosis during hepatitis C therapy approximately 20 weeks after initiating therapy with pegylated interferon α-2b and ribavirin.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

Patient was examined and investigated thoroughly. Temperature was 36.3 C, blood pressure was 138/81, and pulse was 78. Physical examination revealed a tender, firm and distended abdomen with hyperactive sounds. Laboratory analysis revealed hemoglobin at 10.3 g/dL, leukocytes 3.1 K/cmm, urea nitrogen 19 mg/dl, creatinine 0.6 mg/dl, sodium 137 mmol/l, potassium 3.6 mmol/l, chloride 104 mmol/l, bicarbonate 24 mmol/l, calcium 8.6 mg/dl, total protein 6.3 g/dl, albumin 3.1 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 98 U/l, SGOT 20 U/l, SGPT 27 U/l. Laboratory values were consistent with patient’s previous clinic visits. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a fluid-filled, significantly dilated stomach as well as multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels consistent with mechanical small bowel obstruction caused by intussusception of small bowel (Fig. ). After initial fluid resuscitation and antibiotic administration, consent was obtained for emergent exploratory laparotomy. The exploratory laparotomy revealed a 3.0 × 2.5 cm intraluminal calculus in the ileum responsible for the small bowel obstruction, without evidence of intussusception (Fig. ). The obstructing enterolith was ‘milked’ proximally until it reached, and subsequently ‘fell into,’ an isolated 6.0 × 3.0 cm jejunal diverticulum which had not been previously noted on CT imaging. The enterolith was removed along with the segment of the jejunum containing the isolated diverticulum, which was the source of the enterolith (Fig. ). On histologic examination, the mucosa of the extracted diverticulum was found to be granular and erythematous; the remaining small bowel had marked mucosal ulceration and near-transmural inflammation with granulation tissue. Hospital course was complicated by decreased urine output that resolved after fluid resuscitation. On the fourth postoperative day, nasogastric tube was discontinued, diet was advanced and tolerated, and the patient was discharged.

CBC demonstrated multiple cytopenias, including thrombocytopenia ( and ). A review of hospital records noted previous findings of thrombocytopenia as far as four years earlier. Considering pancytopenia an oncology consult was called who reviewed the peripheral smear which showed slight anisocytosis, monocytosis with marked thrombocytopenia with some giant platelets, No pseudo-Pelger-Huet cells or circulating blasts were noted (). Given the laboratory findings, leukemia was considered as a differential and therefore a bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed the differential () granulopoiesis, hypercellular marrow with increased myelomonocytic cells and megakaryocytogenesis (Figure 1B,C). Immunohistochemistry showed CD117: about 5-10% positive cells, consistent with immature cells/blasts, CD34: No increase in CD34 positive cells, CD163: Highlights predominantly monocytic component, CD123: Negative.

He was the first child of non-consanguineous marriage. Three weeks before admission he had received rotavirus, pneumococcal conjugate, pentavalent and inactivated polio vaccines. Before admission he developed fever and watery diarrhea that were treated symptomatically. Upon arrival, he was pale, somnolent and severely dehydrated; thus, intravenous saline solution was immediately infused. Initial laboratory results showed pH 7.32, bicarbonate 13 mEq/L, sodium 107 mEq/L, potassium 6.5 mEq/L and chloride 86 mEq/L with a glomerular filtration rate estimated by Schwartz formula (eGFR) of 55 ml/min/1.73 m2. He also had anemia without hemolytic forms on peripheral smear and thrombocytosis, normal lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia []. During rehydration he suffered a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which was attributed to severe hyponatremia. A magnetic resonance of the brain was normal. After 24 hrs the patient had generalized edema, blood pressure 114/70 mmHg and oligoanuria. Subsequent laboratory evaluations revealed improved renal function, microcytic hypochromic anemia without schistocytes and elevated platelets count. C3 level were decreased and C4 values were within the normal range. Urinalysis showed hematuria and proteinuria in nephrotic range []. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated enlarged echogenic kidneys and ascites.\nBased on clinical and laboratory findings a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome of the first year of life was initially established while decreased C3 led us to investigate a potential infectious origin. However, blood, urine and stool cultures resulted negative. Likewise, viral stool studies and serological tests for syphilis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, parvovirus, mycoplasma and Epstein − Barr virus were all negatives. At that time treatment included albumin plus furosemide and amlodipine for blood pressure control; however, as urine output did not improve a renal biopsy was performed at day 4 after admission. The same day, first of 3 daily boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) was given and peritoneal dialysis was started []. The biopsy showed focal increase in mesangial cellularity, coinciding with reduction in capillary lumens, collapse of glomerular tufts and presence of microthrombi. We did not observe an increase in the mesangial matrix or double contours of the capillary walls employing silver stain. By immunofluorescence, focal and segmental deposits of IgM alone were seen. Also, focal luminal dilation in proximal convoluted tubules, disruption of the brush border and detached epithelial cells, mild interstitial chronic inflammatory infiltrates and isolated microthrombi at inter-tubular capillaries were observed. These findings supported the diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathy []. On this basis, a diagnosis of TMA was made, which was unusual since there were no laboratory data consistent with mechanical hemolysis except for a fall in platelets counts >25% from baseline. A diagnosis of aHUS was established, and daily plasma infusions were administered as a bridge until starting eculizumab therapy. He was immediately vaccinated against Neisseria Meningitidis and Streptococcus Pneumoniae too. Of note, after two plasma infusions his urine output improved leading to discontinuation of dialysis [].\nSimultaneously, the child was fully investigated. Accordingly, isolation of STEC, screening by polymerase chain reaction or detection of free Shiga toxin production in stools as well as lipopolysaccharides IgM antibodies for most common serotypes (O157, O145 and O121) resulted negative. ADAMTS 13 activity was normal (68%) and antibodies against ADAMTS 13 and CFH negative. Homocysteine level (6.2 μmol/l) was normal and antinuclear and anti-double stranded DNA antibodies were negative. Analysis of complement system corroborated a marked activation of the alternative pathway. C3 levels were persistently low (52 mg/dl) with normal C4 (15 mg/dl) concentration. Furthermore, serum functional activity of the classical pathway was 222 UH50/ml (normal value (NV) 180−280) but the alternative pathway was >60 min (NV 7−12). C3 nephritic factor and C3 degradation products (C3d) were negative. Factor B 197 mg/L (NV 229−394), factor H 409 mg/L (NV 329−557), factor I 18 mg/L (NV 15−31) and properdin 16 mg/dL (NV 19−50) levels were within normal ranges. Screening genes encoding complement regulatory proteins, coagulation and other genes causative of aHUS by next generation sequencing (NGS) excluded pathogenic mutations in the following genes: ADAMTS13, C3, CD46/MCP, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, DGKE, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, and THBD. Further, deletion/duplication of CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5 genes were ruled out by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), with an overall diagnostic specificity >99.9%. However, a heterozygous variant in the CFHR3 gene (c.613+2T>C) of uncertain significance was detected. In the following days the patient persisted with edema, but blood pressure became normal without medication and also he recovered the renal function and normalized complement levels. On day 20, treatment was switched to eculizumab at a dose of 300 mg per week for 2 weeks and then every 3 weeks adjusted to patient weight (7.4 kg). At the time of starting eculizumab he had normal renal function but nephrosis persisted []. Notably, after the second dose edema disappeared but hypoalbuminemia and massive proteinuria persisted. No adverse effects of eculizumab use were recorded. Because of familiar reasons the patient continued his follow-up in another country. After 6 months of treatment with eculizumab patient outcome was favorable, with normal renal function, remission of the nephrotic syndrome and without signs of TMA.\n\nWhat is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?\n\nAnion Gap: anion_gap = sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L))",

Trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 55% with no segmental wall motion abnormality and there was no structural abnormality.\nHe was advised to get a stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for the assessment of ischemia. He underwent single-photon emission cardiac tomography (SPECT) with Technetium 99-m (Tc-99). The patient exercised for four minutes on the Bruce protocol and achieved 84% of the maximum predicted heart rate. Technetium-99 was injected at 84% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate. The test was stopped due to exercise limiting chest pain and dyspnea. ECG at peak stress showed >1mm horizontal ST depressions in leads II, III, aVF, and V3 to V5 along with ST elevation in lead aVR (Figure ). ECG changes and symptoms were relieved at six minutes of recovery.\nMyocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) revealed a small-sized fixed perfusion defect of moderate-intensity in the basal inferior segment (Figure ).\nAlthough MPI did not show any ischemia, exercise ECG was positive for symptoms and electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia. He was started on aspirin, rosuvastatin, bisoprolol, and then underwent an invasive coronary angiogram, which revealed multi-vessel coronary artery disease (Figures -).\nHis current treatment was continued and long-acting isosorbide mononitrate added to his treatment regimen.

His chest pain was localized to the right side and was pressure-like, of moderate intensity 4–6/10, nonradiating, and relieved by standing up and worsened by lying flat, but otherwise it was not changed with increase or decrease in activity level. He had no associated palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or lower extremity edema. He had been taking ibuprofen 500 mg orally as needed at home in an attempt to relieve his pain. Two days prior to this presentation, his chest pain became more constant with the same quality. On the day of admission, he developed difficulty in swallowing food. He experienced dysphagia (food stuck in the lower part of his esophagus); however, he had no associated nausea or vomiting. His physical examination revealed the following vital signs: blood pressure 144/75 mmHg and heart rate 72 beats per minute. Pulse oximetry showed his oxygenation was 99% on room air. Examination of his head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed that his condition was normocephalic and atraumatic. His extraocular movements were intact. His pharynx was clear. His neck was supple without jugular vein distention. His chest wall was nontender. His lungs had clear breath sounds bilaterally without any evidence of wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. His cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen was soft and nontender with positive bowel sounds. His neurological examination revealed that he was alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His sensation was intact; he had no facial droop; and his pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation. His cranial nerves were intact. His power was 5/5 in all four extremities.

His blood chemistry findings were as follows: sodium 139 mmol/ (normal range 135–145 mmol/L), potassium 4.1 mmol/dl (3.5–5.2 mmol/dl), chloride 106 mmol/L (96–110 mmol/L), CO2 27 mmol/L (24–31 mmol/L), glucose 105 mg/dl (70–99 mg/dl), blood urea nitrogen 7 mg/dl (5–25 mg/dl), creatinine 0.72 mg/dl (0.44–1.0 mg/dl), aspartate aminotransferase 16 IU/L (10–42 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase 21 IU/L (10–60 IU/L), calcium 9.6 mg/dl (8.5–10.5 mg/dl), bilirubin 0.5 mg/dl (0.2–1.3 mg/dl), and lactate 1.0 mmol/dl (0.5–2.0 mmol/dl). His international normalized ratio was 1.14 (normal range 2–3 with conventional anticoagulation). The finding of his electrocardiogram (ECG) was negative for any ST changes. The patient’s chest x-ray showed a suspected loop of bowel on the right side of the chest (Fig. ). Subsequently, the patient underwent CT of the chest, which showed a 7-cm defect in the right hemidiaphragm anteriorly with a large amount of intra-abdominal fat and a loop of proximal transverse colon within the hernial sac (diaphragmatic hernia of Morgagni). The herniated contents were located in the right pericardial location (Figs. , , and ). A nasogastric tube was inserted to decompress the bowel. The patient was evaluated by a surgeon. Eventually, the patient underwent laparoscopic repair of his diaphragmatic hernia (Figs. , , and ) with a successful outcome. His chest pain and dysphagia resolved completely. When he was seen 6 months later for follow-up, he was completely asymptomatic without any complications.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta ratio?\n\nDelta Ratio: delta_ratio = delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

On admission, her general appearance was acutely ill and generally edematous. A physical examination revealed that her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, her heart rate was 90/min, her respiratory rate was 22/min, and her body temperature was 36.5℃. Her breathing sounds were clear, and her heartbeat was regular without murmur. A subsequent examination of her lower limbs showed asymmetric bilateral pretibial pitting edema predominantly in the left lower limb. In contrast, the right lower limb was less edematous and had very weak popliteal and pedal pulses. Delayed capillary refilling was also found in the right toes. The Homan's sign was negative.\nSerum laboratory findings at admission were as follows: white blood cell count of 5,300/mm3, hematocrit of 39.5% with hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dl, and platelet count of 286,000/mm3. The serum sodium concentration was 141 mEq/L, the potassium concentration was 4.1 mEq/L, the chloride concentration was 104 mEq/L, and total CO2 was 28 mEq/L. The blood urea nitrogen concentration was 12.1 mg/dl, the creatinine concentration was 0.86 mg/dl, the serum total protein concentration was 4.3 g/dl, the albumin concentration was 2.2 g/dl, the total cholesterol concentration was 349.4 mg/dl, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 214.4 mg/dl, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 111 mg/dl, and the triglyceride concentration was 120.1 mg/dl. The results of liver function tests were normal. The coagulation profile showed an activated partial thromboplastin time of 32.0 s, prothrombin time of 9.7 s, anti-thrombin III value of 82% (70-120%), protein C activity of 143% (70-130%), and protein S activity of 65% (58.7-119.2%). The anti-nuclear antibody titer was less than 1:40, the anti-double-stranded DNA titer was 30.9 IU/ml, the C3 level was 158 mg/dl, and the C4 level was 19 mg/dl. Anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin G, anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin M, and lupus anticoagulant were all negative. Urinalysis revealed 3+ proteinuria (spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 10.9 g/g creatinine; spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 7,406.2 mg/g creatinine) and trace hematuria (1-3 red blood cells/high-power field). To investigate the etiology of nephrotic syndrome, an urgent renal biopsy was performed.\nThereafter, although she had no risk factors for thrombosis such as immobilization, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, or a recent orthopedic or gynecologic surgery, to rule out arterial thrombosis of the right lower extremity, lower extremity computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. The CT imaging revealed that the right superficial femoral artery was occluded and there was no identifiable proximal source of thromboembolism in other large arteries (). On the basis of these CT angiographic findings, right lower extremity angiography was performed, which revealed a total occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (). For the treatment of this condition, balloon dilatation was initially tried at the distal superficial femoral artery but failed. Hence, thrombectomy was performed with the Fogarty balloon catheter and the thrombi were successfully aspirated. After the interventional treatment, a good distal arterial flow was reestablished (). Thereafter, warfarin (5 mg/day) as an anticoagulant and corticosteroid treatments were initiated.\nSubsequent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic studies showed no evidence of intracardiac thrombus, vegetation, or other structural abnormalities including patent foramen ovale. Quantitation of proteinuria was confirmed by using a 24-hour urine collection that showed 10.2 g/day of protein excretion and 7.8 g/day of albumin excretion, respectively. Afterwards, with administration of warfarin and corticosteroid, the patient had nearly completely recovered from the edema and claudication and was discharged. The renal pathologic results were consistent with minimal change disease ( and ). Two months after discharge, her urine protein-to-creatinine ratio decreased to less than 0.1 g/g creatinine, her serum albumin level was maintained at 4.1 g/dl, and she had no further symptoms or signs of arterial thrombosis.\n\nWhat is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?\n\nFramingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease: For men, risk_score = 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not, and if age is greater than 70, the age variable is set to 70 within the 'age' term for the β x ln(Age) x Smoker term.

One week ago, he developed grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy. In the preoperative evaluation, electrocardiography and echocardiography were within normal range. Chest X-ray showed mild pleural effusion on both lungs. His laboratory examination showed Hb 9.9 g/dl, platelet count 107 × 109/L, prothrombin time 2.2 international normalized ratio, fibrinogen 82 mg/dl, antithrombin III 12%, sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.0 mmol/L, creatinine 1.1 mg/dl, glucose 144 mg/dl, albumin 3.0 g/dl, total bilirubin 23.1 mg/dl, and ammonia 82 µmol/L. Her Child-Pugh and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores were 12 and 28, respectively.\nUpon arrival at the operating room, his mental state was alert. His systolic/diastolic arterial blood pressure and heart rate were 132/68 mmHg and 98 beats/min, respectively. After establishing institutional standard monitoring, an ultrasound ONSD measurement was done by a physician well-trained in ocular ultrasonography. His ONSD just before anesthesia induction was 4.8 mm (). The bispectral index and suppression ratio were 98 and 0, respectively, and right and left regional cerebral oxygen saturations were 43 and 44%, respectively.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced and maintained by the standard protocol at our institute. His lungs were ventilated with a tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg at a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min (PaCO2, 35-40 mmHg). Intraoperative hemodynamics and laboratory data were shown . He experienced severe hypotension (systolic/diastolic arterial blood pressure: 62/48 mmHg) and bradycardia (56 beats/min) after graft reperfusion, and was treated with epinephrine (20 µg), after which systolic/diastolic arterial blood pressure (122/72 mmHg) and heart rate (92 beats/min) rapidly recovered to within the normal limit. His ONSD was dilated at 5.7 mm to 5 min after reperfusion (), and hyperventilation was performed with a tidal volume of 12 ml/kg at a respiratory rate of 13 breaths/min (PaCO2, 28 mmHg). His ONSD decreased to 5.1 mm at 30 min after reperfusion (), and ventilation was adjusted to maintain normocarbia until the end of surgery.

            "input": "The patient was a 65-year-old woman who had undergone surgery at 19 years of age for appendicitis. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Starting 3 years prior to the current presentation, the patient had gradually developed a gait disturbance, for which she consulted a local orthopedic surgery department, and upon diagnosis of knee osteoarthrosis received conservative therapy. At approximately 1 week before admissions, she had begun to experience loss of appetite and vomiting, and consulted a local physician. On suspicion of gastrointestinal disease, a thorough examination of the gastrointestinal tract was performed, but no organic disease was identified. Although the loss of appetite and vomiting resolved spontaneously, the gait disturbance gradually worsened, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed ventricular enlargement. The patient was thus referred to our department for suspected iNPH related to the gait disturbance.\nHer height of 148.3 cm, weight of 54.4 kg, and body mass index of 24.8 were all within standard ranges. There was no medical history that could have led to secondary hydrocephalus. There were no abnormalities in vital signs with body temperature 36 °C, blood pressure 110/63 mm/Hg, and heart rate 83 beats per minute. Although the patient’s consciousness was clear, 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and there was no muscle weakness, she walked with her legs apart in short quick steps, and required a walking aid. While muscle tonus was normal, the patient complained of mild pain when extending the knee. As to higher order brain functions, mini mental state examination (MMSE) results were 24/30, and the frontal assessment battery (FAB) results were 9/18. Blood test findings at the time of admission were within normal range apart from mild hypoalbuminemia (total protein 4.6 g/dL, albumin 2.7 g/dL, total cholesterol 147 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 100 mg/dL), and elevated thyroid free T3 (TSH 4.333 μIU/mL, free T3 3.78 pg/mL, free T4 1.16 ng/dL). There were no blood-sugar or electrolyte (Na 140 mmol/L, Cl 106 mmol/, K 4.1 mmol/L, serum glucose 73 mg/dL) abnormalities. Head MRI revealed enlargement of all cerebral ventricles, with an Evan’s index of 0.4, and the Sylvian fissure appeared wide open consistent with iNPH. However, the specific feature of narrowing of the sulci at the high convexity area was not obvious (Fig. ). Single-photon emission computed tomography revealed reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) surrounding the Sylvian fissure, with relatively increased CBF in the convexity, which was consistent with the pattern for iNPH (Fig. ). Findings for the sulci at the high convexity area were inconsistent with typical iNPH, however, and we thus reconsidered the possibility of other diseases that may have caused the gait disturbance.\nDetailed tests were ultimately performed after hospital admission including a spinal tap. Following admission, the patient gradually became less active, and tended to stay in bed. Re-examination revealed blood sugar levels of 40 mg/dL and systolic blood pressure of 90 mm/Hg. On suspicion of impaired anterior pituitary function, scans were performed of the pituitary in the diencephalon, and baseline pituitary hormone levels were verified. The spinal tap results were negative. On MRI, pituitary gland was normal measuring 12 mm in maximum diameter with no enlargement or deviation of stalk, and there were no neoplastic lesions, inflammatory lesions in the pituitary area of the diencephalon, or changes suggesting that surgery had been performed in all sequences including contrast-enhanced dynamic images (Fig. ). Table presents baseline hormone levels, and Table the results of the anterior pituitary gland hormone loading test using corticotrophin releasing hormone, thyrotropin releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, and growth hormone releasing hormone. Pituitary hormone results included ACTH <1.0 pg/ml (normal range: 7.2–63.3), and cortisol levels <1.0 μ/dL (normal range: 4.0–18.3), indicating pituitary adrenal insufficiency. There were no decreases in other hormone levels, with relatively mild elevations of growth hormone, prolactin and free T3 levels. We checked carefully again the medical history of the patient, but there were no recent history of exogenous glucocorticoid treatment. An additional pituitary stimulation test was performed, in which ACTH and cortisol responses only were found to have disappeared, and isolated ACTH deficiency was thus diagnosed (Fig. ). After initiation of hydrocortisone supplements, her gait quickly improved. While observing the clinical symptoms, hydrocortisone (Cortril ®) was adjusted to a daily dose of 15 mg, and after instructing the patient as to how to respond on sick days, she was discharged to return home. At approximately 6 months after discharge, although the ventricular enlargement on MRI was same as before, the patient scored 27/30 points on the MMSE and 15/18 points on the FAB.\n\nWhat is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?\n\nFramingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease: For men, risk_score = 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not, and if age is greater than 70, the age variable is set to 70 within the 'age' term for the β x ln(Age) x Smoker term.

He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.\nOn initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.\nThe patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.\nSix months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ).

Her past history was unremarkable, and she neither smoked nor drank alcohol. Her older brother said that she took no medications and she did not use illicit drugs as far as he knew. No history of head trauma was obtained. At the time of admission, her blood pressure was 140/70 mmHg with a pulse rate of 90 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 12 cycles/minute, and a temperature 37.1°C. Our patient was stuporous and there were no lateralizing signs or neck stiffness. Both planter reflexes were down. Our patient underwent a battery of investigations with the following results: hemoglobin 13.6 g/L; total white cell count 9100/mL3; platelets 270,000/mL3; mean corpuscular volume 84fL; mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 33 g/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate 19 mm/hour; blood urea 35 mg/dL; serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL; serum sodium 139 mEq/L; serum potassium 4.1 mEq/L; serum calcium 8.9 mg/dL; serum total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL; aspartate transaminase 21 u/L; alanine transaminase 19 u/L; alkaline phosphatase 190 u/L; serum total protein 7.3 g/dL; serum albumin 4.4 g/dL; thyroid stimulating hormone 2.9 u/L; serum total triiodothyronine 1.3 nmol/L; serum total thyroxin 89 nmol/L; serum total cholesterol 177 mg/dL; serum triglyceride 100 mg/dL; low density lipoprotein cholesterol 128 mg/dL; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol 20 mg/dl; high density lipoprotein cholesterol 38 mg/dl; prothrombin time 12 seconds; activated partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds; a serum Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test was negative; and general urine examination and microscopy were unremarkable. Blood and urinary screening for cocaine, opioids and amphetamines was negative. A 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal. A non contrast brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral hypodensities in her corpus striatum (Figure ). In addition, there was a small hyper dense area at the anterior part of her right globus pallidus. The physician suspected encephalitis, and managed our patient accordingly. He ordered serology for toxoplasma and human immunodeficiency virus, and a lumber puncture was done: all of these tests turned out to be negative. At day four of admission, our patient became comatose, and our neurology department was consulted. The Glasgow coma scale was 3/15, no neck stiffness was detected, and both planter reflexes were up. On day five, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with gadolinium revealed hemorrhagic infarctions involving both basal ganglia (Figure ). Brain magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) were normal. Serum anti nuclear and rheumatoid factors as well as anti phospholipid antibodies were negative. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic examinations were normal, as was the carotid Doppler study.\nOur patient was managed as ischemic stroke with secondary hemorrhagic transformation. Anti hypertensives and a statin were prescribed. Anti platelets and anticoagulation were not given. Gradually over a period of three weeks, our patient's consciousness improved to a degree of mild drowsiness. As for her language assessment, comprehension was intact but there was no speech output; she uttered few sounds, however, but no comprehensible words. She had generalized rigidity and hypokinesia.

One day prior to admission, the patient suffered from an acute onset of progressive, worsening upper abdominal discomfort, frequent episodes of diarrhea (2–3 times/day), loss of appetite, and fulminant jaundice without systemic symptoms. Laboratory results revealed elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (2,452 IU/L), ALT (1,161 IU/L), and GGT (301 IU/L), with high total bilirubin (392 μmol/L; direct bilirubin level: 345 μmol/L), and thrombocytopenia (119×106/L); C-reactive protein was markedly elevated (41.6 mg/L). HAV, HCV, and HIV were excluded. Serologic markers of previous CMV, EBV, and T. gondii infections were positive. Abdominal ultrasound showed known macronodular liver cirrhosis with manifest splenorenal shunting and splenomegaly. Anti-HEV IgM (165.9 IU/mL) and IgG (212.6 IU/mL) antibodies were positive. To exclude acute HBV-associated liver failure, polymerase chain reaction testing was performed using a commercially available kit (Abbott Laboratories, USA) to detect HBV-DNA (<12.5 IU/mL). HEV RNA was detected (9.76×105 copies/mL), and sequencing revealed HEV genotype 3f. Due to the severity of his condition, the patient was immediately transferred and underwent a high-urgency liver transplantation (CMV-positive transplant). The patient experienced the following complications: an ischemic cerebrovascular accident, acute renal failure, corticoid-induced diabetes mellitus, and CMV reactivation one month post-transplant (plasma viral load: 1,493 IU/L).\nIn September 2013, the patient died as a result of cardiac deterioration.

His last known normal neurological status was 1 h prior to arrival to the hospital. He had also been experiencing cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and abdominal pains for about 3 weeks. He had gone to a different emergency room 1 week ago and was diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection and was advised over the counter cough medicine after obtaining a chest X-ray that was normal. His past medical history included possible hypertension for which he was on medication at one point, but currently off medication. He is a non-smoker. His blood pressure was 131/86 mm Hg, heart rate was 120 beats per minute, temperature was 36.4 °C, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and pulse oxygenation was 99% on room air. His neurological examination was consistent with expressive aphasia with right sided facial weakness. His sensation and motor function was intact in all four extremities with no ataxia. His other physical examination was unremarkable. His lab work () including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were normal except for a creatinine of 1.58 mg/dL (normal: 0.61 - 1.24 mg/dL). His international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.18 (normal: 0.88 - 1.15), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was 27 s (normal: 26 - 39 s), D-dimer was 1,221 ng/mL (normal: < 500 ng/mL). His hemoglobin A1c was 5.8% (normal: < 5.7%), total cholesterol was 191 mg/dL (normal: < 200 mg/dL), triglycerides were 242 mg/dL (normal: 0 - 150 mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was 25 mg/dL (normal: 39 - 79 mg/dL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 107 mg/dL (normal: < 100 mg/dL).\nIn the emergency room, he received 325 mg of aspirin, and was assessed by a code stroke team. He was not recommended tissue plasminogen activator (tpA) by the tele-neurologist as he had inconsistent symptoms. His chest X-ray was normal, carotid ultrasound showed no stenosis, and computed tomography of the head showed subtle area of diminished attenuation in the right cerebellar hemisphere and left frontoparietal lobe for which a subtle area of infarction could not be excluded. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain completed the following day revealed acute to subacute infarcts in the right cerebellum and left and right frontoparietal cortical regions. He was started on aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily.\nHe was also tested for COVID-19 and his test result came back with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. He was started on azithromycin, zinc, and vitamin C. He had an echocardiogram of the heart which revealed an ejection fraction of 26-30% (normal: 55-60%) with abnormal left ventricular diastolic function, mildly increased left ventricular wall thickness, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate global hypokinesis. A cardiologist evaluated him and deemed that he needed to have a transesophageal echocardiogram and left heart catheterization to determine the etiology of the newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy once he is recovered from his acute ischemic event and COVID-19.\nOn hospital day 4, he was found to have new global aphasia and left upper extremity weakness. He received a stat computed tomography of the brain (), which revealed a new right middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction involving the right frontoparietal lobe and insular cortex. At that point, he was loaded with 600 mg of clopidogrel and transferred to the neuro-intensive care unit. It was decided that since he failed antiplatelet therapy, that the antiplatelet medications aspirin and clopidogrel would be stopped and full-dose anticoagulation was commenced with enoxaparin.\nHe had hypercoagulability testing done, including antithrombin III, homocysteine, antinuclear antibody, beta-2-glycoprotein, cryoglobulin, and functional protein C, all of which were negative. He did have further testing of lupus anticoagulant which was positive; however, this test was not reliable as he had it done after being started on anticoagulation, which invalidates the reliability of the result.\nFor his cardiomyopathy, he was placed on a beta-blocker, angiotensin receptor blocker, and a diuretic. He had workup done for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), thyroid function tests, hepatitis serologies, and ferritin levels which were all within normal limits except for slightly elevated ferritin of 523 ng/mL (normal: 24 - 336 ng/mL), which was not high enough to cause cardiomyopathy. He remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the hospital stay. He was advised to have repeat echocardiogram done on an outpatient basis along with ischemic workup including left heart catheterization.\nHe recovered from the symptoms of COVID-19 including shortness of breath and cough and on the day of discharge, he was saturating 98% on room air and was stable from a pulmonary standpoint.\nHis hospital course was further complicated by dysphagia requiring a gastric feeding tube, healthcare-associated pneumonia, and staphylococcus bacteremia requiring prolonged antibiotics. He was discharged on the novel oral anticoagulant apixaban and advised repeat hypercoagulability testing in 3 months. He went to a rehabilitation center.\n\nWhat is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?\n\nFramingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease: For men, risk_score = 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not, and if age is greater than 70, the age variable is set to 70 within the 'age' term for the β x ln(Age) x Smoker term.

Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13,900/mm2, a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, and a platelet count of 228,000/mm2. Serum biochemistry showed creatinine level, 6.6 mg/dL; albumin level, 3.0 g/dL; alanine aminotransferase level, 36 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase level, 38 IU/L; bilirubin level, 1.2 mg/dL; and alkaline phosphatase level, 198 IU/L with normal electrolytes.

An esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed no evidence of bleeding. Colonoscopy was performed after standard bowel preparation and under sedation with 3 mg of midazolam. The colonoscopic findings showed diffuse bowel wall edema. Upon examination of the distal transverse colon, we found several deep linear red mucosal breaks resembling scratches ().\nIn the ascending colon, dark purple edematous mucosa and necrotic epithelial lesions were found (). Cecal intubation was not performed because of severe ischemic changes with necrosis. The remaining colorectal mucosa was grossly normal.

His medical history was unremarkable, but one year previously his gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels had risen to 271 IU/L (normal: < 30 IU/L). Prior to this, the patient had consumed 540 mL of sake three times a week, and he had been reducing the amount of alcohol he consumed for about one year. He did not smoke or take any recreational drugs. He was single, was not homosexual, and he had not had sexual intercourse for over one year.\nThe patient had undergone treatment of his internal hemorrhoids as an outpatient at a nearby hospital that comprised an aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) injection. He developed a fever of 38 °C, dark colored urine, and itchy skin on postoperative day (POD) 1, and he took loxoprofen sodium, as required. He consulted another doctor on POD 7, because the symptoms had not improved, and his blood test results led to a diagnosis of liver dysfunction. His liver dysfunction had not improved by POD 14, and he was admitted to our hospital on POD 15.\nThe patient was 167 cm tall and weighed 52.5 kg. He presented with a blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.6 °C, and 99% oxygen saturation in room air. No specific physical findings were evident during the clinical examination on the day of hospitalization, but the patient had a rash, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice. The subjective symptoms, comprising the fever, dark colored urine, and itchy skin, had disappeared by POD 10.\nThe laboratory test results showed that the patient’s complete blood count was almost normal with a white blood cell count of 6900 cells/μL, a hemoglobin concentration of 14.7 g/dL, a hematocrit level of 43.1%, and a platelet count of 3.98 × 105 cells/μL, but a higher percentage of eosinophils was present (6.8%) (normal: 1.0%-5.0%), which peaked at 13.9% on POD 20. The patient’s serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were elevated at the time of admission. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 432 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 911 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was 473 IU/L (normal: 115-359 IU/L), and the total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL). Thus, compared with the ALP level, the AST and ALT levels showed greater magnitudes of elevation. The patient’s other blood test results were within the normal ranges, as follows: serum albumin: 4.0 g/dL (normal: 3.8-5.2 g/dL); serum creatinine: 0.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.65-1.09 mg/dL); C-reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL (normal: 0-0.3 mg/dL); prothrombin time: 100% (normal: 80%-120 %); thyroid-stimulating hormone: 0.5 μIU/mL (normal: 0.34-4.04 μIU/mL); triiodothyronine: 2.98 pg/dL (normal: 2.36-5.00 pg/dL); and thyroxin: 1.18 ng/dL (normal: 0.88-1.67 ng/dL). The serological tests for autoantibodies generated weakly positive results (1:40) for anti-nuclear antibodies, and negative results for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Negative results were obtained from the tests for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the hepatitis C virus antibody, rapid plasma reagin, the anti-Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and the anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, and from the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test. The IgG level was within the normal range at 1415 mg/dL (normal: 800-1600 mg/dL) and the IgM level was within the normal range at 100 mg/dL (normal: 60-250 mg/dL). The IgE level was elevated at 1333 mg/dL (normal: < 250 mg/dL). Chest radiography did not reveal any abnormalities. No morphological changes were evident following abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and abdominal computed tomography (Figure ).\nWhen the patient was hospitalized, we considered viral, alcohol-induced, autoimmune, drug-induced, biliary tract, and thyroid function-based diseases as frequent causes of acute liver dysfunction for the differential diagnosis, and, based on the patient’s medical history, and the serological and imaging results, we considered that alcohol and DILI were highly likely causes of the patient’s acute liver dysfunction. However, the patient had stopped drinking during the past year, so we thought that there was a high likelihood of DILI. Therefore, we began conservative treatment with a small amount of extracellular fluid replacement.\nFigure presents the patient’s symptoms, laboratory test results, and treatment over the entire course. The liver transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased rapidly after admission, and the maximum levels were as follows: ALT: 950 IU/L on POD 15; AST: 470 IU/L on POD 17; and total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL on POD 17. The ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed consistent downward trends from POD 7. The patient's symptoms disappeared on POD 10, and no new symptoms appeared after hospitalization. We performed a liver biopsy on POD 25, and a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) of the components of the ALTA injection and lidocaine on POD 28. The patient was discharged on POD 29, and he was managed as an outpatient without any prescriptions. At the time of the patient’s first outpatient appointment on POD 35, his liver transaminase and bilirubin levels had declined and were almost within the normal ranges.\nFigure presents hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of the liver biopsy performed on POD 25. The H and E staining showed that the basic structure of the liver had been maintained without any hepatocyte dropout or disruption, and that the bile duct had not been disrupted. At a higher magnification, the H and E staining showed that the parenchymal cells were partially dilated and that a mild inflammatory cell infiltration was present in the area of the central vein. Neither eosinophil nor plasma cell infiltrations were detected within the liver tissue. Bile plugs were found at multiple sites within the parenchyma and sinusoids. Masson staining did not show the presence of liver tissue fibrosis.\nThe lymphocyte proliferation activity levels, which were determined from the DLST performed on POD 28, were 676 counts per minute (cpm) for the control and 871 cpm for the ALTA with lidocaine. The stimulation index, which was calculated as the ALTA with lidocaine cpm divided by the control cpm, was 1.29 (normal in Japanese people: < 1.8).\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

The patient developed nonbloody, large-volume diarrhea after eating take-out 11 days ago, with four to five bowel movements per day. During this time, she also experienced fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, general malaise, and weakness. In addition, she observed leaking and drainage around her G-tube site with associated erythema and intense abdominal pain. The patient denied sick contacts or recent travel.\nHer past medical history includes obesity, orthostatic hypotension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis, gastrojejunal ulcer, Kawasaki’s disease, subdural hemorrhage, epilepsy, chronic pain syndrome, and anxiety. The patient’s past surgical history includes burr-hole craniotomy, lithotripsy, cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass complicated by chronic refractory marginal ulceration and small bowel obstruction requiring two resections, ventral hernia repair, and gastrostomy tube insertion.\nThe patient was pregnant six times and had six miscarriages (G6P0060). She lives with her husband and adopted son with good social support. She is currently unemployed. The patient denies ever smoking and does not drink alcohol. Familial history consists of diabetes, heart disease, and nephrolithiasis in the patient’s mother. Her father had glaucoma, nephrolithiasis, and prostate cancer.\nMedications before admission included pantoprazole 40 mg twice a day, sucralfate 1 g twice a day, ondansetron 4 mg twice a day as needed for nausea, midodrine 10 mg three times a day, fludrocortisone 0.1 mg twice a day, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, levetiracetam 1500 twice a day, methadone 10 mg every 8 hours, and lorazepam 0.5 mg daily as needed for anxiety. She was also on daily vitamin A, D3, and B-complex supplements and a monthly cyanocobalamin 1000 μg intramuscular injection, in addition to a nutritional supplement Isosource 1.5 Cal that is administered through the G-tube once every night.\nDue to her complex past surgical history, the patient was sent from her local emergency department to our hospital. At presentation, the patient was febrile to 101 ℉. Blood pressure was 110/72 mmHg, and heart rate was 84 beats per minute. Further examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness with erythema and purulent drainage around the G-tube site on the left upper quadrant. The general examination showed a thin patient who is alert and oriented. Mucous membranes were moist. Lungs were clear to auscultation as she was breathing comfortably on room air. Heart sounds were regular without murmurs. Extremities were warm with intact pulses bilaterally and no edema. However, she had moderate muscle loss for her age. Skin was intact except for the previously mentioned erythema around the G-tube. Neurological examination revealed normal speech with comprehension, intact cranial nerves II–VII, XI, and XII, and 5/5 motor strength in all four extremities. Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick throughout. Romberg test was negative. Gait was slowed owing to weakness but showed normal balance.\nSerum chemistry showed sodium of 136 mmol/L, potassium of 2.9 mmol/L, chloride of 111 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 20 mmol/L, magnesium 1.2 mg/dL, calcium 6.1 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. Liver function tests showed low albumin of 2.5 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 86 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 13 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 21 U/L. Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 3.97 × 109 /L, hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 39.6%, and platelet count of 239 × 109 /L. Urinalysis showed normal appearance and color, specific gravity of 1.020, without detecting red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), ketones, glucose, leukocytes esterase, or nitrites. A stool sample was sent for Clostridium difficile and a molecular enteric panel but was pending at that time. Two out of two blood cultures that were collected at her local emergency department were positive for Gram-negative rods. An abdominal radiograph confirmed G-tube location overlying the stomach and a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed nonspecific skin thickening and subcutaneous fat stranding along the G-tube insertion site (Fig. ). Due to a prior history of penicillin and sulfa anaphylactic reactions, the patient was empirically treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 8 hours for bacteremia, and oral clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours for the cellulitis surrounding her G-tube site, in addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline at 75 mL/hour and electrolyte repletion with oral potassium chloride 20 mEq for four total doses, and intravenous magnesium sulfate 4 g once.\nA fluoroscopy G-tube study revealed no contrast leak or evidence of obstruction. On day 1 of hospitalization, the molecular enteric stool panel was positive for the Salmonella species. On day 4, two out of two blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis with susceptibilities to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient was then transitioned from intravenous ciprofloxacin to a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours. We resumed tube feeds through the G-tube on day 5 after a successful clamping trial. On day 6, the patient was somnolent and difficult to arouse, with poor skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. Vital signs remained within normal limits; T max of 98.6 ℉, blood pressure of 98/65 mmHg, and heart rate of 95 beats per minute. Laboratory results were significant for a serum creatinine level of 5.25 mg/dL and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with sodium of 131 mmol/L, chloride of 105 mmol/L, and serum bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L. These clinical and laboratory findings of dehydration suggested the development of prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of prolonged GI volume loss. The patient was resuscitated with half normal saline containing 75 mEq sodium bicarbonate additive at 125 mL/hour. On day 8, the patient’s mental status improved but her G-tube began to leak, prompting clamping of the G-tube. The patient was encouraged to increase oral intake. Intravenous fluids were discontinued on day 9, as she was able to tolerate oral foods and liquids well. No further leakage was seen around her G-tube site. On day 13, the patient was discharged home with a peripherally inserted central line to finish a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 hours).\nFollowing completion of a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone, the patient made a full recovery with resolution of her diarrhea and abdominal pain. Tube feeds were resumed without further issues. At a 4-month follow-up visit with her bariatric surgeon, the patient reports that she is doing well and happy with her progress. Electrolytes and serum creatinine were all within normal limits. The patient was readmitted 6 months following her initial hospitalization for abdominal pain and hematemesis due to a large marginal ulcer. She improved with conservative measures including bowel rest (nothing per os) and maintenance intravenous fluids, and was discharged 2 days later. At the time of discharge, her hemoglobin remained stable at 11.2 g/dL, and she was able to tolerate an oral diet. She continues to follow up with her bariatric surgeon in clinic with no recurrence of fever or diarrhea.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Anion Gap: albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL))",

            "input": "A 57-year-old man sought medical attention at our hospital after experiencing progressive limb weakness and sensory abnormalities for six weeks. The patient had developed nephrotic syndrome three years earlier. The results of his renal biopsy suggested the presence of PLA2R-associated MN and fulfilled the criteria for stage 3 MN, but immunotherapy had not yet been administered. Results of the initial physical examination at admission indicated symmetric limb weakness with Grade V- muscle strength in all four limbs; strength was impaired in both proximal and distal muscles in the upper and lower limbs, poor stability and accuracy in the finger-to-nose and heel-to-knee-to-shin test, loss of tendon reflexes, decreased proprioception, and decreased distal superficial sensation in a glove and stocking pattern. The patient required mobility aids for walking. Neuroelectrophysiological results were as follows: motor distal latency prolongation ≥50% above the upper limit of normal values (ULN) in the bilateral peroneus and right medianus; reduction of motor conduction velocity ≥30% below the lower limit of normal values (LLN) in the bilateral medianus, right musculocutaneous nerve, femoral nerve, and left peroneus; motor conduction block, ≥30% reduction of the proximal relative to distal negative peak compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude in the bilateral medianus, right ulnaris, and left peroneus; sensory conduction abnormalities (prolonged distal latency or reduced sensory nerve action potential [SNAP] amplitude or slowed conduction velocity outside of normal limits) in the medianus, ulnaris, radial nerve, peroneus supers, and suralis. This was mainly manifested in the distal lower limbs (), which fulfilled the electrophysiological diagnostic criteria for CIDP developed by the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (1). Results of the routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical analysis were as follows: chloride, 132.2 mmol/L; glucose, 3.00 mmol/L; protein, 1.65 g/L; and total cell count, 7/uL (nucleated cell count: 7/uL). Other biochemical test results were as follows: serum albumin, 29.8 g/L; triglycerides, 1.09 mmol/L; total cholesterol, 4.75 mmol/L; high-density lipoprotein, 1.03 mmol/L; and low-density lipoprotein, 2.85 mmol/L. The serum PLA2R antibody titer measured by ELISA was 23.75 RU/mL (negative: <14.00 RU/mL). Abnormalities were not found in the anti-NMDAR, anti-AMPAR1, anti-AMPAR2, anti-LGI1, anti-CASPR-2, and anti-GABABR antibodies in CSF. Tests for paraneoplastic antibodies (Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2/CRMP5, Ma1, Ma2, SOX1, Tr, Zic4, GAD65, PKCγ) and anti-ganglioside antibodies (GM1, GM2, GM3, GM4, GD1a, GD1b, GD2, GD3, GT1a, GT1b, GQ1b) in the serum were negative. Abnormalities were not found in complement and immunoglobulin levels and monoclonal immunoglobulins were not detected on immunofixation electrophoresis.

He denied any contact with animals or travel abroad, had not consumed unpasteurized food, and had his last unprotected sexual intercourse 4 months earlier.\nHe was taking no medications and was known for alcohol abuse (mainly beer and spirit, approximately 185 alcohol units/week), drug abuse (cocaine, ecstasy, cannabis, methylphenidate, clonazepam, lorazepam), and smoking tobacco. On physical examination, he was afebrile and hypotensive (blood pressure 94/50 mmHg) with a normal heart rate (77 beats/minute). Oral examination revealed dry mucosa and erythematous tonsils without exudate, cardiopulmonary examination was normal, abdominal palpation was unremarkable, and no cutaneous rash was noted. Testing of the lower limbs revealed preserved strength and sensitivity as well as symmetric deep tendon reflexes.\nLaboratory findings showed normocytic, normochromic, hypoproliferative anemia (hemoglobin 99 g/l, normal range 140–180 g/l) with thrombocytopenia (24 G/l, normal range 150–350 G/l), left shift without leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein (213 mg/l, normal range < 10 mg/l), elevated transaminases (three times the upper limit of normal) with cholestasis and elevated conjugated bilirubin (29 µmol/l on admission, 190 µmol/l on hospital day 8, normal range 0.5–9.5 µmol/l). There was a stage 3 acute kidney injury according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria with a serum creatinine of 112 µmol/l on admission and 247 µmol/l on hospital day 3 (patient’s baseline value 70 µmol/l), a serum urea of 11.4 mmol/l on admission (12 mmol/l on hospital day 3), and preserved urine output. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria (spot urine: protein 1.4 g/l, creatinine 11.5 mmol/l, urine protein–creatinine ratio 1.076 g/g), albuminuria (2+ on semiquantitative analysis), presence of 97 M/l leukocytes, 25 M/l erythrocytes, and renal tubular cells (1+ on semiquantitative analysis). Sodium excretion was high (fractional excretion of sodium on spot urine 3.56%). Due to the context of sepsis, hypovolemic status of the patient, and urinalysis findings, acute tubular necrosis was the suspected mechanism of acute kidney injury.\nAnalysis of serum electrolytes showed mild hyperphosphatemia (1.53 mmol/l, normal range 0.80–1.45 mmol/l), hyponatremia (131 mmol/l, normal range 136–144 mmol/l), mild hypouricemia (246 µmol/l, normal range 286–518 µmol/l), low serum chloride (94 mmol/l, normal range 98–106 mmol/l), hypokalemia (2.8 mmol/l, normal range 3.6–4.6 mmol/l), and an anion gap of 10 mmol/l. The transtubular potassium gradient was elevated (16.4). Albumin level was 29 g/l (normal range 35–48 g/l), and creatinine kinase level was 312 U/l on admission, rising to 404 U/l the next day and normalizing on hospital day 4. Blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.49 (normal range 7.35–7.45) with elevated bicarbonates (29.3 mmol/l, normal range 22–26 mmol/l) and normal pCO2 (5.25 kPa, normal range 4.7–6.4 kPa). Urine pH was 6 (normal range 5–6.5). Presence of glycosuria (7 mmol/l, normal range 0.1–0.9 mmol/l), with concomitant euglycemia (6.6 mmol/l, normal range 4.1–11 mmol/l) and a hemoglobin A1c of 5.1% was highly suspicious of proximal tubular dysfunction.\nUpon admission, Streptococcus A rapid test was negative, chest radiograph was normal, and an abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly, a heterogeneous parenchyma with hyperechogenicity around periportal spaces and lymph nodes, liver parenchymal arterialization, and a layer of perihepatic fluid, all consistent with hepatitis. The bile ducts were not dilated. Kidneys were of normal size and morphology, without any urinary tract dilatation. On the second day after admission, the patient developed drowsiness and confusion with high fever (exceeding 40 °C). Normal cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar puncture excluded central nervous system infection. Clinical features were suggestive of bacterial sepsis [sequential organ failure assessment [SOFA] score of 10], justifying empiric broad spectrum antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone and oral clarithromycin.\nDetailed history revealed that the patient swam in a river in the Geneva lake area 1 week before hospital admission, raising the diagnostic suspicion of leptospirosis in this clinical setting. Serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Leptospira interrogans was positive, and specific serologies revealed elevated IgM levels (> 100 U/ml, normal range < 15 U/ml). Although IgG levels were below the positive threshold, the values increased from < 2 U/ml initially to 6 U/ml 1 week later (normal range < 10 U/ml). Unfortunately, no ulterior dosage was performed. Antibiotic therapy was changed to intravenous amoxicillin–clavulanate and doxycycline for 7 days with clinical improvement. Serology for hantavirus was performed, revealing an indeterminate result due to nonspecific reactions. Considering the positive results for Leptospira interrogans, additional tests for hantavirus were not performed.\nAlong with clinical improvement, kidney function recovered with creatinine normalizing to 87 μmol/l on the sixth hospital day, and all electrolyte abnormalities resolved. Liver tests also normalized as confirmed by a routine blood sample 1 year after discharge. In addition, glycosuria significantly decreased from 7 to 0.5 mmol/l on the 12th day of hospital stay.\n\nWhat is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?\n\nSerum Osmolality: sOsm = 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18)",

            "input": "A 51-year-old woman who presented with diarrhoea containing mucus and blood had initially been diagnosed with acute severe ulcerative pan-colitis and backwash ileitis at the age of 49 years at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) in December 2014. She had poliomyelitis when she was very young, and there was nothing special regarding her family or psychosocial history. Serology was positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and negative for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA). Her condition was refractory to steroids and complicated by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Ultimately, she underwent sub-total colectomy and ileostomy in February 2015. Pathological examination of the resection specimen showed diffuse pan-colitis consistent with UC and no indications of Crohn’s disease (Fig. ). She did well in the following 11 months; prednisone was tapered and stopped within 2 months, and she gained 5 kg of weight after the ileostomy. In January 2016, a scheduled restorative ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with proximal neo-ileostomy was performed.\nFrom one month after the IPAA, her 24-h stool collection slowly increased to 1.5–2 L. Next, she noticed decreased urine output since April. In early May 2016, she presented to our emergency room with repeated unconsciousness over the course of 10 days. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 74/50 mmHg; heart rate (HR), 90 bpm; additionally, she exhibited a poor nutritional status (160 cm; 39 kg). On physical examination, active bowel sounds were noticed to occur approximately 7–9 times per minute. Her serum creatinine level was 183 μmol/L, indicating acute kidney injury. Treatment with fluid replacement and noradrenaline maintained her BP at 80–90/50–60 mmHg and gradually normalized her creatinine level. However, her 24-h watery stool collection persisted, and she developed fever and vomiting. While many leukocytes were found in stool collected from the diverted ileostomy, repeated stool cultures and tests for Clostridium difficile toxins were negative. Tests for CMV-DNA, CMV-pp65 and EBV-DNA were performed and were all negative. The patient was not on any medications, including NSAIDs, upon verification. Her treatment with steroids was stopped before the end of April 2015. Empirical treatment with antibiotics, including ceftazidime, metronidazole and oral vancomycin, was administered with no response. Due to her reliance on noradrenaline, relative adrenal insufficiency was suspected, and hydrocortisone was initiated at 50 mg q6 h intravenously. Her stool volume decreased to less than 500 ml per day quickly, by which time the treatment with noradrenaline was successfully stopped. The levels of D-lactate, endotoxin and diamine oxidase indicated that the barrier function of the intestine was compromised and that bacterial translocation may have occurred. Oedematous inflamed mucosa with patchy superficial ulcers was observed in the diverted pouch by pouchoscopy. Although an upper endoscopy and an endoscopy through a stoma revealed a normal gross appearance in the stomach, duodenum and pre-stomal ileum (Fig. a, b), the histological examination of tissue biopsies of both the duodenum and pre-stomal ileum revealed enteritis, as indicated by moderate villous atrophy, cryptitis, decreased goblet cells, and severe active inflammation with neutrophil infiltration in the lamina propria, as well as negativity for intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Fig. a-d). From these lines of evidence of histological enteritis presenting in the duodenum, pre-stomal ileum and diverted pouch, we considered pan-enteritis to be present, and we diagnosed the patient with post-colectomy enteritis. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone at 30 mg intravenously once a day with tapering by 5 mg every 7 to 10 days; however, her stool volume from the ileostomy still gradually increased to 3–4 L. After a multidisciplinary team discussion, ileostomy closure was debated as the final rescue treatment and was performed in August 2016. Two months later, her stool volume decreased to less than 1 L per day, and she gained 2.5 kg of weight. Azathioprine at 50 mg/d was prescribed during the tapering of prednisone. Until the last follow-up in March 2018, she performed well, with an increase in body weight to 50 kg, and daily defecation approximately 5–6 times at less than 1 L/day, sometimes with form (Additional file ). Gastroduodenal endoscopy and pouchoscopy were repeated annually and showed normal villi in the descending duodenum and neo-ileum in March 2018 (Fig. c, d). Gradually, the histology changed, showing recovery of the villous atrophy, cryptitis and inflammation in the lamina propria to normal (Fig. e-f).\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

She was admitted to the hospital due to fatigue, shortness of breath while playing with friends one month ago. Physical examination on admission revealed a systolic murmur in the left para-sternum, trans-thoracic echocardiography showed a peri-membranous VSD extended into inlet septum with a diameter of 12 mm, left to right shunting, pressure gradient via the defect was 20 mmHg, a PDA of 4 mm in diameter. The patient had undergone trans-catheter PDA closure first, and 3 weeks later, TES was performed for VSD repair without robotic assistance.\nPatient was placed in supine position; two arms were along the body, under general anesthesia with single-lumen endotracheal tube. We used a no.6 Knitted Dacron graft (Vascutek Terumo, Bangkok, Thailand) which was connected to the right common FA of the patient with an end-to-side anastomosis. The other side of the graft was connected to the arterial line of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. Superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) cannulae were inserted via internal jugular vein (IJV) and femoral vein, respectively, using Seldinger technique. When CPB was started, the arterial pressure gradually increased to 260 mmHg, we switched to bilateral FA cannulation with an additional 10Fr FA cannula (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn, USA) (the predicted size was 16Fr) was directly inserted to the left common FA. After having additional femoral cannula, the arterial pressure declined and stabilized at 180–200 mmHg.\nFour soft trocars (Covidien, Hampshire, Mansfield, USA) were placed in the right chest of the patient, included: one 12 mm trocar in the 5th intercostal space (ICS) at the anterior axillary line as the main working port, one 5 mm trocar in the 4th ICS at the mid-axillary line as the second working port, one 5 mm trocar in the 5th ICS at mid-axillary line as the camera port and one 5 mm trocar in the 6th ICS at the mid-axillary line for left atrium sucker. After snaring SVC, we pushed a 16 G Surflo® I.V. Catheters (Terumo Corporation, Laguna, Philippines) into the ascending aorta through the anterior right chest wall and used it as an aortic root needle. Myocardial protection was achieved by antegrade Custodiol® HTK solution (Koehler Chemi, Alsbach-Haenlien, Germany) through aortic root after clamping aorta by Chitwood clamp (Scanlan International, Inc, St Paul, MN, USA).\nRight atrium (RA) was opened in parallel to atrioventricular groove, atrial septal was intact, and we punctured atrial septum at the location of ovale foramen to place the drainage of left atrium. The defect was exposed by taking some stitches to hang RA wall to the pericardium. The lesion extended into the inlet septum, some chordae tendineae of septal and anterior leaflets of tricuspid valve crossed the defect. We split the commissure of anterior and septal leaflets to clearly expose the defect. The VSD was closed using artificial patch, continuous combined with interrupted suture (). The RA was closed using two layer of continuous suture after the split in the leaflets and the ovale foramen had been closed. After declamping the aorta, the heart re-beat in sinus rhythm, de-airing via aortic root needle. Extracorporeal circulation was then stopped and the operation was finished with no difficulties.

Past medical history was significant for depression, anxiety, previous suicide attempts (with pill ingestions and wrist slitting), sexual abuse (rape), benzodiazepine addiction (underwent rehabilitation) and migraines. Her home prescription medications included buspirone and paroxetine. She had used amitriptyline in the past as well. She denied any history of drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes or using illicit drugs. There was no family history of psychiatric disorders or liver-related diseases.\nVital signs showed a blood pressure of 111/59 mm Hg, temperature of 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 139 beats/min, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Physical examination showed an alert yet anxious patient who had no signs of jaundice, bruising, hepatic encephalopathy or asterixis. Neurological exam on initial presentation revealed normal reflexes. On abdominal exam, there was tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant with normal active bowel sounds.\nInvestigations\nSerum hematology tests showed white blood cell count 15,500 cells/micro liter (normal: 4,200-10,200), hemoglobin 10.8 (normal: 11.5-14.8), platelets 99,000 cells/micro liter (normal: 150,000-400,000), International Normalized Ratio (INR) 5.3 (normal: 0.8-1.0), prothrombin time (PT) 47.9 sec (normal: 11.7-14.5). Serum chemistry tests showed sodium 138 mEq/L (normal: 136-145), potassium 5.2 mEq/L (normal: 3.5-5.1), chloride 102 mEq/L (normal: 98-107), bicarbonate 15 mEq/L (normal: 22-32), anion gap 25 mEq/L after correcting for albumin (normal: 8-12), blood urea nitrogen 37 mg/dL (normal: 7-18), creatinine 3.31 mg/dL (normal: 0.52-1.21), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 16.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 (normal: > 60), albumin 2.6 g/dl (normal: 3.4-5.0), total bilirubin 3.4 mg/dl (normal: 0.2-1.0), alkaline phosphatase 142 U/L (normal: 45-117), AST 9368 U/L (normal: 15-37), ALT 7982 U/L (normal: 13-56), lactic acid 11.1 mEq/L (normal: 0.4-2.0), acetaminophen level 8.8 mcg/mL. Urine drug screen for illicit substances was negative. Ultrasound of the abdomen done in the ED showed hepatic steatosis (see Figure ) but no biliary dilatation.\nThe patient was diagnosed with high anion gap metabolic acidosis/lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury, elevated INR due to acetaminophen toxicity and was started on an intravenous N-acetylcysteine drip after initial volume resuscitation. She received intravenous vitamin K which helped correct her INR to 2.8. Given elevated transaminases, all her home prescription medications (including bupropion and paroxetine) were held on admission. In order to address her persistent nausea and vomiting, she was also started on scheduled intravenous metoclopramide 10 mg every six hours the following day by the hospital medicine team. With resuscitation and conservative management, her condition continued to improve during five days of her hospital stay with improvement in transaminases (AST 98 and ALT 851 U/L), acidosis/lactic acid (1.3 mmol/L), INR (1.5) and creatinine (1.4 mg/dl) by the time of discharge. Intravenous N-acetylcysteine was discontinued on hospital day 5. However, as a result of scheduled every six-hour intravenous metoclopramide use, on hospital day 4, she was found to have a blood pressure of 146/109 mmHg, heart rate 120 beats/min, clonus, tremors and hyperreflexia (see Video ). A diagnosis of metoclopramide-induced serotonin syndrome was made. Metoclopramide was promptly discontinued. Given her history of benzodiazepine addiction, patient and family members were reluctant to try intravenous lorazepam for symptom mitigation. Serotonin syndrome promptly resolved over the next 36 hours and she was discharged to a mental health facility under the care of a psychiatrist. The patient was seen in outpatient clinic two weeks later when her liver enzymes, creatinine, INR had normalized and the patient was back to her usual state of health.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Anion Gap: albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL))",

On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis.

Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal.

Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.\nOn day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative.

Physical examination found no signs of abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness, and liver and spleen were impalpable.\nLaboratory examination results were as follows: blood routine examination (hemoglobin 132 g/L, red blood cell count 4.61 × 10 12/L, white blood cell count 10.04 × 10 9/L, blood platelet count 180 × 10 12/L), liver enzymes (ALT 10.0 U/L, AST 17.0 U/L, GGT 16.0 U/L, ALP 86.0 U/L, TBIL 12.7 μmol/L) and renal function (BUN 5.65 mmol/L, SCr 42.0 μmol/L). Serum tumor markers AFP, CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 were all within normal limits.\nHer past medical history included hemangioma for 20 years, and asthma for 30 years, and she underwent hysteromyomectomy 8 years ago. She did not smoke or drink. The splenic ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechogenic foci measuring 5 to 38 mm in diameter. The contrast-enhanced CT showed multiple space-occupying lesions in the spleen, mottled low-density lesions, multiple hypoattenuating nodules with no contrast enhancement on the arterious phase. Delayed contrast-enhanced helical CT scan displayed incomplete filling of hypodense splenic lesions. Imaging findings raised the suspicion of a vascular neoplasm of the spleen (Fig. A and B).\nGiven that it was uncertain whether it was a benign or a malignant tumor of the spleen, a laparoscopic total splenectomy was performed for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment and informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images. Grossly, the spleen measured 11 cm × 6.5 cm × 2.5 cm. The largest lesion measured 2 cm × 2.3 cm × 3.6 cm. Histopathologically, the tumor was characterized by multiple cystic structures with anastomosing vascular channels (H & E staining ×50) (Fig. ). Photomicrograph of the histologic specimen (H & E staining ×400) showed a high power view of the cystic structures demonstrating tall columnar endothelial cells without cytologic or nuclear atypia that lined the cyst-like spaces (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry showed that the cells compromising the tumor were positive for CD21, CD31, CD68, and CD163 (Fig. ).\nAccording to the histology and immunohistochemistry findings, the diagnosis of LCA of the spleen was thus established. The patient was discharged 6 days after the splenectomy. Her postsurgical course was uneventful, intermittent abdominal distention disappeared, and no surgery-related complications were found. After surgery, Aspirin (100 mg qd) was used to prevent thrombosis. One month after discharge, the patient's blood routine and clotting routine were normal, and Aspirin was stopped to use. The follow-up imaging findings at 16 months after surgery showed no signs of recurrence. From the patient perspective, the result of surgical treatment was satisfactory.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nCKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate: GFR = 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coefficient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

As no medical records were available, previous growth velocity could not be evaluated. The patient reported that he had always been short for his age throughout his childhood.\nHis recent medical history was negative for headaches, vomiting, or vision changes. There were no reports of fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, and skin or hair changes. Appetite was normal with no recent weight loss. There were no academic concerns. He regularly played football, with no history of traumatic or nontraumatic fractures. He took no medications. For several months, he had reported minor bilateral symmetrical crookedness on his second fingers, without any pain or local symptoms.\nHe had been born at 36 gestational weeks, weighing 2450 g with no history of abnormal gestation, breech presentation, ischemic insult at birth, or other neonatal events.\nParental heights were normal, with a target height of 177.5 cm. Parental pubertal timing was also within normal limits. Family history was negative for short stature, endocrine, or autoimmune conditions.\nClinical examination revealed a dysmorphic, proportionate, and relatively short adolescent with normal vital signs. His anthropometric parameters were −2 SDs (standard deviations) for weight (37 kg) and between −2 SDs and −2.5 SDs for height (148 cm) (Belgian charts). His height was below his midparental genetic interval. His upper:lower segment ratio and arm span were normal. His hands and feet appeared short, with middle, painless tumefaction of soft tissue around the index proximal interphalangeal joints. No spinal abnormalities were noted, but a mild pectus excavatum was present. There was no thyromegaly. Testicular and pubic hair development was in Tanner stage II (testicular volume 6 ml). The most prominent dysmorphic features were a pear-shaped nose, a thin upper lip with small lower jaw, prominent ears, and markedly thin and sparse blonde hair with rarefaction of the lateral eyebrows (). The teeth examination was difficult because he wore dental braces to correct dental irregularities.\nAn extensive biological workup was performed. Complete blood count and serum levels of inflammatory markers, electrolytes, glucose, renal function, liver enzyme, and tissue transglutaminase antibody levels were normal. The laboratory findings showed normal thyroid and adrenal function and normal growth hormone secretion (normal levels of insulin-like growth factor and insulin-like growth factor binding protein). Additional pituitary and gonad testing revealed a normal prolactin level and pubertal testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (). The bone age was evaluated at 12 years 6 months.\nA renal and cardiac ultrasound looking for other possible somatic malformations [] wasperformed and showed normal morphological kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladder and no cardiac abnormalities.\nAfter this first clinical, biological, and radiological evaluation, the working diagnosis was constitutional growth delay with late normal puberty, but skeletal dysplasia (dysmorphic features in the context of short stature) was considered for differential diagnosis.\nDuring the follow-up 6 months later, the initial apparent soft tissue tumefaction of his indexes had progressed to localized noninflammatory and painless deformity, causing limited difficulty in writing and typing on a keyboard. This sign was isolated, and the patient did not complain of pain or history of local trauma or infection. At this time, his clinical appearance was normal, except for the aforementioned dysmorphic traits. His growth velocity (5 cm/6 months) was normal in the context of spontaneous pubertal progress (Tanner stage III, testicular volume 8–10 ml).\nClinical examination of his hands revealed isolated ulnar deviation of the second fingers and symmetrical deformity of proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands (). He had no other painful or deformed joints.\nHis feet look normal, but the toes are short ().\nTheoretically, a differential diagnosis with inflammatory arthritis was considered, but the clinical findings (dysmorphic features, short stature, and relatively asymptomatic finger abnormalities) were more suggestive of a skeletal dysplasia. Radiographs of hands, feet, and pelvis were performed and allowed the definitive diagnosis.\nThe plain radiograph of his wrists showed cone-shaped epiphyses of the middle phalanges of the second digit of both hands with moderate deviation of the phalangeal axis (Figures and ).\nSimilar cone-shaped epiphyses were found in the proximal phalanx of the great toe and up to the fourth one of both feet with shortness of all toes ().\nNo other radiological joint impairments (juxtaarticular osteopenia or erosions) were found. Radiographs of the pelvis and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (looking for fine abnormalities, particularly long bone cysts not visible on plain radiographs) [] were normal. The bone age was retarded at 12 years 6 months (the chronological age was 14 years 6 months).\nTaking together the clinical and particularly the radiological findings, the correct diagnosis of trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS) was achieved. This was a delayed diagnosis, and our explanations for this include the underrecognition of the dysmorphic features (in our first examination), the underinterpretation of fingers tumefaction in the clinical context, and consecutively no hand radiological exam being conducted.\nOther entities associating ectodermal and skeletal phenotypes were reviewed, particularly Albright osteodystrophy, acrodysostosis, and other brachydactyly syndromes, but several features of the presentation were inconsistent with these diagnoses.\nCytogenetic analysis was not performed. The family history appeared to be negative, his parents and his sister do not manifest the syndrome phenotype, and in such conditions, a sporadic case of TRPS type I was considered highly possible.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

Her medical history revealed mild degree heart failure, chronic normocytic anemia, gastritis, and allergy for NSAIDs and penicillin antibiotics.\nHer preoperative laboratory tests: hemoglobin 8.8 mg·dL−1, hematocrit 30.9%, leukocytes 11,500 mm−3 without deviation, platelets 453,000 mm−3, sodium 131 mg·dL−1, potassium 4 mg·dL−1, magnesium 0.58 mg·dL−1, creatinine 0.5 mg·dL−1, and total calcium 8.24 mg·dL−1.\nIn the preoperative room we prepared our patient by antibiotics prophylaxis: ciprofloxacin 2 gm; metronidazole 500 mg and an antiemetic agent; ondansetron 4 mg.\nOur patient was monitored by pulse oximetry, expiratory capnography, invasive and noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, bispectral index (BIS), neuromuscular transmission (TOF Guard), and diuresis.\nA peripheral venous access (20 G) was established in upper right limb, and also a central venous access was done immediately after the induction phase as it was needed for postoperative chemotherapy afterwards.\nWe induced our anesthesia by oxygen, propofol 50 mg, fentanil 100 mcg, and rocuronium bromide 30 mg, and then we proceeded to a rapid sequence endotracheal intubation (tube diameter was 6.5 mm),\nThe maintenance of the anesthesia was achieved by continuous infusion of remifentanil in a dose of 0.2 mcg/kg/min, rocuronium bromide 10 mg, xenon 60–65%, and O2 35–40%, the fluid replacement was calculated depending on her diuresis, plasma fluid, intraoperative blood loss, and anemia, and she was refunded by ringer lactate 1500 mL, Nacl 0.9% 1000 mL, fresh plasma fluids 1000 mL, and packed red cells 500 mL.\nA closed-circuit anesthesia machine (Felix Dual, Taema) was used for xenon gas delivery. The ventilation parameters were the following: “pressure-cycled mechanical ventilation with inhalation pressure indexes of 19 cm H2O, respiratory frequency 12 incursions per minute, PEEP 5 cm H2O, FiO2 35–40%, and inspiratory/expiratory time ratio 1 : 2, and the exhaled tidal volume was around 380 mL.”\nBlood gas analysis was performed twice: 30 minutes after the start and 30 minutes before the end of surgery.\nWe registered electrolyte disorders, and they were resolved by administration of KCL 40 mEq and Ca++ gluconate in dose of 1 g·10 m−1 (Tables and ).\nAfter 5 minutes from the end of the surgery we noticed our patient starting a voluntary respiratory activity with a high BIS level, so we decided to proceed for the emergence phase and extubation reversing the neuromuscular blocking by sugammadex in a dose of 100 mg [] with careful monitoring for her cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Both modified Aldrete score and BIS values were recorded ().\nAfter 13 minutes we got the complete recovery of our patient, she was awake without any confusion state, delirium, or cognitive dysfunction, also she had excellent and stabile both hemodynamic and respiratory functions, postoperative pain control was achieved by continuous intravenous infusion of morphine (5 mg over 24 h), and she was transferred to ICU for close monitoring.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

The patient had been in his usual state of health, until he told his family 3 hours before that he “felt sick.” The family incidentally found him on the floor, confused and lethargic, and immediately called the ambulance.\nUpon arrival, the patient had a temperature of 96.4°F; pulse, 117 beats per minute; blood pressure, 151/93 mmHg; respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation of 100% on nonrebreather. The patient was known to have a history of recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, and his last episode of hepatic encephalopathy was in the prior 3 months, which was treated and controlled with lactulose. The patient's family stated that the patient had run out of lactulose 4 days before presentation. Other than lactulose, the patient was compliant with all of his home medications, including amlodipine, buproprion, cyclosporine, hydrocodone, lasix, methocarbamol, and ramipril. The patient had no known history of seizure, recent illness, brain trauma, or recent surgical procedures.\nPhysical examination showed a male in no acute distress with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 12 (eyes, 4; verbal, 3; motor, 5). There were no signs of trauma found on his body. His pupils were equally round and reactive to light, and his neck was supple and soft with a cervical collar in place. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable except for tachycardia. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Because he was not following commands, the neurologic examination was limited. However, the patient was able to move all extremities equally and pulses were distally equal to all extremities. There was no posturing or clonus noted, and Babinski was downgoing in both feet.\nFingerstick glucose level was 210 mg/dL and bedside hemoglobin level was 13.1 g/dL. Noncontrast head and cervical spine computed tomography revealed no acute pathologic lesion. Chest radiography also showed no acute pathologic lesion. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell counts of 5.5 K/mm3 with 60% neutrophils, hematocrit of 36.5%, and platelets of 115 K/mm3. Electrolyte and liver function results were as follows: sodium, 141 mmol/L; potassium, 3.5 mmol/L; chloride, 104 mmol/L; bicarbonate, 22 mmol/L; calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 71 mmol/L; creatinine, 1.9 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 2.1 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 128 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 124 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 231 U/L; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; lipase, 30 U/L; prothrombin time, 14.5 seconds; INR, 1.09; and ammonia, 501 μmol/L (reference range, 15–55 μmol/L). Toxicology serum screen results were negative for acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol. Urine toxicology screen results were positive only for opiates. Venous blood gas was pH 7.44.\nOwing to the patient's obtunded condition and inability to protect his airway, the patient was electively intubated and given midazolam drip for sedation. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring with a presumed diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. While administration of empiric antibiotics was started in the emergency department, it was discontinued after an infectious etiology was deemed unlikely and culture results were negative. Results of a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan were also negative, including no evidence of infarct.\nDuring the ICU stay, the patient was readministered lactulose, and ammonia levels decreased to117 μmol/L by hospital day 2 and to 78 μmol/L by hospital day 4. Despite discontinuation of sedation, the patient remained unresponsive. A neurologist was consulted and a bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed findings consistent with status epilepticus. However, the patient had no clinical manifestations of status epilepticus, leading to a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. A phenytoin load was immediately administered, while a midazolam infusion was restarted, ultimately leading to EEG resolution of the status epilepticus.

            "input": "We present the case of a 48-year-old man, complaining of a bilateral knee injury and functional disability. The patient fell about two meters down an embankment one hour before the presentation and was unable to stand up due to pain, so he was brought to our hospital by ambulance.\nClinical examination revealed a marked bilateral swelling of both knees, severe pain at the passive mobilization of the knee joints, pain-limiting active flexion to less than 30°, and an inability to actively extend the knee joints or to perform an active straight leg raise bilaterally. Additionally, weight-bearing had hardly been possible. There was a loss of fullness and a palpable deficit at the inferior poles of his patellae. Testing of the ligamentous knee joint stabilizers was significantly limited by guarding due to the severe sharp pain. The patient's medical history revealed that a couple of years earlier, he had a right knee sprain resulting in an acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which was treated conservatively. The patient does not take any drugs regularly, and we note that he is allergic to levofloxacin. The weight and height of the patient were recorded at the physical examination as 107 kilograms and 180 cm, with a body mass index (BMI) of 33.\nPlain radiographs of his knees showed bilateral knee effusions with patella alta (high-riding patellae) on both anteroposterior and lateral views. Insall-Salvati ratios measured 1.6 and 1.47 for right and left knee, respectively () (normal values range from 0.8 to 1.2; patella alta > 1.2 and patella baja < 0.8). Moreover, the irregularity and incongruity of the patellar tendons on the lateral radiographs were additional signs suggestive of the extensor mechanism's rupture and consistent with the tendons' rupture from the lower pole of the patellae bilaterally.\nOur patient was operated under general anesthesia 48 hours after the accident. He was placed in the supine position. The clinical examination under anesthesia of both knees demonstrated a full instability of the MCL with a valgus stress test at both 0 and 30° of knee flexion. No laxity was demonstrated in the remaining ligaments of the knee joint. The lower extremities were prepared and draped together in the usual sterile fashion. The intervention was performed without the use of a tourniquet.\nOur ligamentous reconstruction was approached by an anterior longitudinal midline incision. Dissection was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the patellar and quadriceps paratenon, which were carefully preserved. The patellar tendon rupture was identified near the proximal osteotendinous junction bilaterally (). The hemarthrosis was evacuated, and the joint was copiously irrigated. A chronic tear of the right ACL was identified, with the proximal portion of the ligament missing and only scar tissue remaining with the ACL stump adhering to an intact Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL). A complete proximal (femoral) MCL tear was identified bilaterally, confirming our clinical suspicion. The medial and lateral retinacula, which were involved as well, were identified for later repair.\nAt first, with the same incision, the MCL tear was approached. Proximal reinsertion at the level of the medial femoral condyle using a DePuy Mitek super QuickAnchor™ Plus DS® was done to ensure the stability of the medial motion plane. Then, after debridement of the tendinous tissue and visualization of the inferior pole of the patella, three DePuy Mitek super QuickAnchor™ Plus DS® were screwed into the medial, middle, and lateral thirds of the patella in the proper coronal plane. The purchase of the anchors was tested as we were able to deliver the patella to the distal extent of the incision by pulling on the anchor sutures. Then, a circumferential 1.2 mm thick stainless steel wire was passed through the center of the thickness of the patella superiorly and the tibial tuberosity inferiorly. Gradual tension was applied on the metallic wire to obtain the optimal patellar height, confirmed by an intraoperative lateral X-ray. One suture in each anchor was used to create a running Krackow stitch distally through the tendon, ensuring that full-thickness bites were obtained.\nThe second limb of each suture was passed in a locked fashion through the proximal free tendon and tied within the substance of the tendon. The additional suture within each anchor was incorporated into the repair for reinforcement in a simple continuous fashion. The reconstruction was further protected by a strip of quadriceps tendon measuring 10 × 1 cm, long enough to cover the patellar tendon, which was harvested and turned down. The edges of the turned down quadriceps tendon were fixed to the underlying patellar tendon using slowly absorbable interrupted sutures (Vicryl 2.0). Next, the medial and lateral retinacula tears were repaired using interrupted No. 2 PDS sutures (Ethicon; Somerville, New Jersey, USA). The strength of the repair was tested bilaterally through a gentle range of motion; a flexion up to 130° was possible.\nPostoperatively, the legs were placed in knee immobilizer braces, with the knees locked in full extension. The postoperative course was uneventful, and radiographic control was satisfactory (). On the second postoperative day, the patient began ambulation with a walker while keeping the extension knee braces. Full weight-bearing was permitted as tolerated, along with isometric quadriceps-strengthening exercises. The rest of the protocol is as follows: knee flexion exercises limited to 45° were started at the second postoperative week. He had no pain and reached 45° of active bilateral knee flexion. He had an active flexion of 80° at the sixth week, and the knee braces were discontinued. In the eighth postoperative week, the patient achieved a bilateral active complete knee extension and could walk without crutches. As part of his daily physiotherapy program, he was allowed full knee flexion along with a focus on muscle strengthening exercises. Twelve weeks after surgery, the patient presented 100° maximum bilateral knee flexion and returned to work.\nUpon examination seven months after surgery, the patient showed an adequate range of motion of both knees (135° flexion, 0° extension) (). Quadriceps muscle, the primary contributor to knee joint stability, had a good strength with no clinical signs of muscular atrophy or extensor lag. The patient denied any sense of instability, and, consequently, he returned to his recreational sports activities. In addition, he reported feeling that his knees were as strong as they were before the accident. At the final follow-up 12 months after the injury, the patient was symptom-free and extremely satisfied as he recovered completely.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?\n\nAdjusted Body Weight: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg))",

Acral dusky erythematous with minimal scaly plaques was present. Mucosa and other cutaneous sites were not involved. A provision clinical diagnosis of nail psoriasis was made. Potassium hydroxide and periodic acid–Schiff staining of the nail were negative for fungal elements. Nail biopsy was denied. Routine hematological and biochemical investigations were normal. Initially, topical tazarotene 0.1% cream at night and a combination of calcipotriol–clobetasol propionate ointment twice a day was advised and continued for 8–10 weeks. Later on, acitretin was planned and started at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg daily along with topical calcipotriol. It was increased to 0.6 mg/kg daily and continued for 4–5 months. Gradual tapering of the dose was done and stopped completely. The patient was maintained with topical tazarotene gel thrice in a week and emollient daily. All biochemical tests were within normal limits during the course of treatment. There was remarkable improvement in discoloration, pitting, and disappearance of subungual hyperkeratosis in almost all his nails []. The patient was in regular follow-up.

Ultrasound (USG) of the breasts did not show any fibroglandular proliferation in both breasts; however, deposition of adipose tissue in the subcutaneous plane was noted, suggestive of pseudogynecomastia. Based on his USG report and low value of total testosterone, a working diagnosis of pseudogynecomastia was made. Tablet tamoxifen was started, in consultation with the department of endocrinology.

            "input": "A 52-year-old male patient, a chronic smoker and drinker, a welder (exposed to occupational respiratory hazards for about 20 years), presented to the emergency department for severe dyspnea with sudden onset on the previous day, cough and right posterior chest pain, chills, and high fever (39 °C). The patient had a series of comorbidities: hepatic steatosis, chronic alcohol liver disease, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease, and essential hypertension.\nObjective examination showed an agitated, tachypneic patient, with congested facies, dry skin and mucosae, harsh vesicular murmur, right basal crepitant rales, with peripheral oxygen saturation 92%, blood pressure 200/160 mmHg, ventricular rate 106 bpm, afebrile at the time of examination.\nChest X-ray evidenced a pulmonary condensation area in the posterior inferior third of the right lung (A,B).\nLaboratory tests revealed leukopenia with lymphopenia (white blood cells 1110/μL, lymphocytes 190/μL), thrombocytopenia (127.000/μL), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (15.6 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.15, hepatocytolysis (aspartate aminotransferase 88.8 units/L, alanine aminotransferase 82.8 units/L), total bilirubin 2.88 mg/dL, reduced creatinine clearance (63.8 mL/min), nitrogen retention (creatinine 1.82 mg/dL), inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein 450 mg/L), antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2 were not detectable, nonreactive anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies. Combined throat/nasal sampling (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania) was performed for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) SARS CoV-2 (QuantStudio v5 analysis method with TaqPath COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit, The QuantStudioTM Design & Analysis Software, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pleasanton, CA, USA). The result was negative. Respiratory secretions were not collected for microbiological diagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of right basal pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute chronic liver dysfunction, and acute kidney injury was established. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Anti-inflammatory steroid, antibiotic, antihypertensive, oxygen therapy was initiated. The patient died 17 h after presentation.\nThe necropsy was performed 12 h after death. Necropsy exam revealed the following: about 1700 mL of serous fluid in the right pleural cavity, with gray deposits, which were also present focally on the surface of the right pleura, and about 500 mL of serous citrine fluid in the left pleural cavity. The middle lower lobe of the right lung had a well-demarcated red-gray area, with small violaceous areas of increased consistency, having a dry, granular cross section surface. The adrenal glands showed bilateral medullary hemorrhage. No signs of autolysis were identified.\nGiven the persistence of the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, five lung fragments (0.5/0.3 cm) were collected by cutting with scalpel from the red-gray area, middle lower lobe (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania). RT-PCR testing was performed on these lung fragments and the result was positive. Total RNA isolation was performed with NucleoSpin RNA for tissue (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The E gene assay (Envelope gene) was used as the first line screening tool (Ct 23) then followed by confirmatory testing with an RdRp gene assay (Ct 25.3) (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene—inside the Orf1ab polyprotein gene) and N gene assay (Ct 26.5) according to the Charite/Berlin protocol [].\nFor the histopathological examination, we used an Olympus BX40 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) with an Olympus Camedia 4040 photo camera, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain (staining kit produced by Laboratorium, Bucharest, Romania), Giemsa stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and Grocott stain (staining kit produced in our own laboratory). For immunohistochemistry, CD3 (Dako, polyclonal rabbit anti-human) and CD45 (Dako, monoclonal mouse antihuman, clone 2B11 + PD7/26) were used. The immunolabeling reaction was carried out by an automated immunostainer (Leica Bond-Max, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) using a polymer-based detection system (Leica Biosystems, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidin (DAB) as the chromogen.\nThe histopathological examination of the case evidenced preexisting lesions in various organs, which could be assigned to preexisting morbidities, favoring the severe evolution of COVID-19 infection. The histopathological examination also detected recent lesions occurring in the context of COVID-19 infection.\nIn the lung tissue, a background of lung fibrosis (A), with emphysematous areas (B) and thickened septa with myofibroblasts (C,D) was seen.\nOn this fibrosis background, the large and small arterial lung vessels show many thromboses (). The thromboses are accompanied by subpleural hemorrhagic foci (Tardieu spots, resulting from acute hypoxia), as well as by acute pulmonary edema foci in the rare alveoli unoccupied by inflammatory exudate. In the thrombosed vessels, lymphocytes adherent to the endothelium, with a significance of endotheliitis () but with low intensity, can be seen. In the dilated perivascular lymphatics, there is a cell-rich lymph fluid, with a cellularity similar to that of alveolar exudate (A).\nEosinophilic (A) and basophilic microthrombi (B) can also be observed, which represent aspects of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\nThe alveolar exudate is rich in foam cells ( and ). Alveolar exudate immunolabeling is positive for the leukocyte common antigen (CD45, a commonly used marker of hematopoietic cells except for erythrocytes and platelets) (A), but negative for CD3 (a common antibody for identifying T cells) (B). Immunolabeling of the innate immune system cells for induced nitric oxide (iNOS) is extremely weak ().\nIn the alveoli filled with macrophages, cystic forms with multinuclear content were also present (B). These proved to be positive by Giemsa stain (A,B), Grocott-Gomori’s methenamine silver stain (C), and PAS stain (D).\nGiemsa stain also evidenced the fact that focally, some alveoli were invaded by a population of filamentous bacteria, in those areas the alveolar exudate having a bronchopneumonic, bacterial superinfection appearance ().\nIn the pleura, the whitish exudate described macroscopically was a mixture of fibrin and basophilic granular material, rich in round cells with vesicular nuclei. These cells were positive by Giemsa and Grocott staining, supporting the diagnosis of pneumocystosis (). Starting from these pleural images suggestive of Pneumocystis, it was inferred that the foamy alveolar material phagocyted by the activated macrophages was probably identical to this basophilic granular material, and the cystic forms described in were Pneumocystis cystic forms.\nThe myocardial muscle fibers are hypertrophied and fragmented, and in the medium intramyocardial venous vessels, rare microthrombi are present (A). In the liver, alcoholic steatosis is seen. In the medium and large branches of the suprahepatic veins, there is inflammatory infiltrate which allows the diagnosis of phlebitis (B). The kidney presents diffuse tubular necrosis (shock kidney) (C), and in the adrenal glands, massive medullary hemorrhage can be observed (D). The kidneys (mainly located within the interstitium) and liver (portal spaces and sinusoids) are CD45 positive.\n\nWhat is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?\n\nFibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT)",

Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.\nFrom February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.\nThe patient had no medical history of past illness.\nThe patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.\nThe height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.\nIn July 2016, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to guide therapy at diagnosis. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA.\nOn March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung. Thus, the classification was PD, and the patient failed to respond to two lines of therapy.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?\n\nAdjusted Body Weight: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg))",

Permanent tunneled catheters were placed into the right internal jugular vein as the patient was not fit for AVF creation due to vascular occlusions.\nOn 7 April 2019, at the end of a dialysis session, the patient developed fever (39°C) and chills. Fever was documented at 39°C, was associated with chills and rigors, and was not responding to antipyretics. In the emergency department, the patient reported no change in weight, loss of appetite, or night sweats. She denied any history of respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological symptoms. On examination, the temperature was 39°C, the blood pressure 150/75 mm Hg, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The patient was fully conscious and oriented. The remainder of the general medical examination was normal.\nShe was admitted to our nephrology unit with possible source catheter-related blood stream infection. She was started on ceftazidime 2 gm IV once daily and vancomycin 1 gm IV Q HD as per the protocol. The white blood cell count was 13.3 × 103 cells, C-reactive protein was 278 mg/dl, and procalcitonin was 52.27. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, and chest radiography was negative.\nBlood culture from venous and central catheters was sampled separately, and the causative microorganism was identified as a Gram-negative, motile, lactose-fermenting bacillus, which was identified by the Vitek MS automatic identification system using a GN card as Leclercia adecarboxylata. Antibiotic sensitivity testing using Vitek 2 showed that it is an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer. The results are summarized in (). The L. adecarboxylata strain was resistant to most beta-lactams, including narrow, expanded, and broad-spectrum cephalosporins. But it was susceptible to all quinolones and carbapenems tested.\nThe treatment regimen was changed to meropenem 500 mg IV once daily and gentamicin based on antibiotic susceptibility tests (ASTs) from blood cultures. This targeted therapy was successful, and the patient became afebrile.

The patient had suffered from hypertension and hyperlipidemia since the age of 50. He had undergone total hip replacement for right femoral head fracture caused by a traffic accident at the age of 71, and he received a surgical procedure for lumber spinal stenosis at the age of 74. Borderline diabetes mellitus with HbA1c levels ranging from 6.0% to 6.6% was pointed out since the age of 72, while the blood glucose level remained within a normal range. At the age of 76, the diagnosis of hypertensive and diabetic chronic kidney disease was made. The patient suffered from pneumonia when he was 78 years old. One year before admission, an infected cyst (abscess) around the right femoral prosthesis was indicated by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured, and the first and third-generation Cefem plus new quinolone were continuously administered. Three months before admission, continuous drainage from the infected lesion was conducted. No gastrointestinal complaints were recorded prior to the final admission.\nHis watery diarrhea was severe, more than 10 times a day, and hematochezia was associated. The body temperature was 37.5°C, blood pressure 138/90 mm Hg, heart rate 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 96% while breathing ambient air. The body weight was 57.0 kg with a body mass index at 22.0. Systolic heart murmur was auscultated. The abdomen was soft with weak bowel sounds. There was tenderness of the whole abdomen on palpation, without guarding, rigidity, distention, or mass formation. Main results of laboratory tests on admission included the following: white blood cells 4400/μL, hemoglobin 13.3 g/dL, platelets 305 000/μL, Na 135 mmol/L, K 3.6 mmol/L, Cl 102 mmol/L, Ca 6.4 mg/dL, Pi 4.6 mg/dL, albumin 1.8 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 49.9 mg/dL, creatinine 5.3 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 26.1 mg/dL. The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with long PR and QT intervals. Deterioration of renal functions for the last 10-year period is illustrated in Figure . For the last 3 months, hemodialysis was needed.\nPlain and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, performed on the first and eighth days of hospitalization, respectively, indicated significant ischemic changes of the sigmoid colon through the rectum with wall thickening of the sigmoid colon, ascites retention, bilateral pleural effusions, and mild renal atrophy. Colonofiberscopy indicated diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and ischemic changes and erosions of the stenotic sigmoid colon through rectum (Figure ). Microbiologically, the stool proved normal flora, and fecal Clostridium difficile toxin test and blood microbial culture were negative. The clinical diagnosis of ischemic and infectious colitis secondary to the long-term usage of antibiotics was made. Intravenous infusion of ceftriaxone for 5 days was chosen empirically because it is metabolized in the liver. However, it was ineffective for relieving diarrhea and colitis, and then meropenem was chosen for controlling the intractable colonic symptoms. Inflammation peaked out 14 days after the treatment, but soon, the inflammatory reaction and diarrhea re-exacerbated. The patient expired 26 days after admission. No free air was observed in the abdominal cavity on the contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan 3 days before death.\nThe autopsy was conducted 6 hours after death. In the sigmoid colon, fibrosing and adhesive diverticulitis with mucosal ischemic changes and erosions were grossly observed. Microscopically, eosinophilic hyaline material was deposited throughout the gut wall. The deposits were congophilic. Immunohistochemically, amyloid A, visualized by the monoclonal antibody mc-1 against serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), was identified in the lamina propria mucosae through the subserosa, including diverticular and vascular walls (Figure ). In the prepylorus of the stomach, a large perforating ulcer measuring 12 mm was found, and purulent peritonitis with turbid ascites was associated (Figure ). Candida infection was microscopically demonstrated on the involved mucosa and serosa at the site of gastric perforation (Figure ). Candida albicans were cultured from turbid ascitic fluid containing a total of 1150 mL. Candidal esophagitis was also noted. Deposition of amyloid A was evident in the gastric mucosa through the subserosa, and the amyloid deposition was especially prominent and seen in the full-thickness of the mucosa at the site of gastric perforation (Figure ). Amyloid A was also diffusely deposited in the wall of the esophagus through the rectum. Pleural effusion was associated (left: 150 mL, right: 300 mL).\nSystemic congophilic deposition of amyloid A was further demonstrated in the tongue, salivary gland, thyroid gland, lung, heart, pancreas, splenic white pulp, adrenal glands, kidney, urinary bladder, and ureter. The deposition was especially pronounced in the thyroid gland (38 g) and urinary tract.\nAtrophic kidneys weighed 72 g (left) and 73 g (right). Microscopically, amyloid A deposits caused amyloid glomerulopathy in association with vascular wall involvement. Features of diabetic glomerulosclerosis were indistinct because of marked amyloid deposition, while arteriolosclerosis was observed. Pancreatic islets focally showed diabetes-related localized hyaline (amyloid) deposition. Characteristically, co-deposition of amyloid A and IgM in the renal glomerulus was demonstrated by immunostaining using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections after prolonged protease-1 digestion (Figure ). IgG and IgA were undetectable. The co-deposition of amyloid A and IgM was scarcely observed in the systemic amyloid A deposits outside the kidney (Figure ).\nMost of the hepatocytes were immunostained with the anti-SAA1 monoclonal antibody mc-1. Cytoplasmic granular positivity was evident. The acinar cells of the pancreas and salivary gland were also positively stained. These findings indicated accelerated production of SAA1 protein by these cells as a prolonged inflammatory response (Figure ).\nAnother incidental finding included aortic stenosis caused by dystrophic calcification in the cusps of the aortic valve. Left ventricular hypertrophy (heart weight 415 g) was caused by both aortic stenosis and amyloid deposition. The aorta revealed severe atherosclerosis. The abscess lesion around the right femoral prosthesis was not evaluated.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?\n\nMean Arterial Pressure (MAP): MAP = 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure)",

Consequently, three years later, she underwent open surgical revision which was converted to an open RYGB with concomitant cholecystectomy. She had lost over 100 kg since the first bariatric procedure (166 kg preoperatively to 63 kg on presentation). However, she developed multiple complications, including chronic lower extremity lymphedema, small bowel obstruction requiring multiple surgical interventions, malabsorption secondary to short bowel syndrome, multiple vitamin deficiencies, wet beriberi requiring chronic thiamine replacement, osteoporosis causing a left hip fracture, and chronic low back pain.\nIn July 2018, she initially presented to the emergency department with increasing lower extremity edema secondary to chronic lymphedema. On arrival, her vital signs were within normal limits. Her physical exam was remarkable for bilateral lower extremity pitting edema extending to the hips and an otherwise unremarkable exam. A chest x-ray disclosed no cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion. Her last echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 60% with no wall motion abnormalities.\nDuring the admission, the patient received intravenous bumetanide with significant improvement. However, she developed waxing and waning episodes of confusion, and on day 3 of her hospitalization became overtly encephalopathic. She was disoriented to person, time, and space, with bizarre affect as well as incoherent speech, unable to recognize her close relatives. On physical exam patient was lethargic and had asterixis. According to her family members, the patient had previous episodes where she would become lethargic, but never to this degree.\nLaboratory results were significant for an elevated plasma ammonia level of 173 μmol/L (normal range 11 - 50 μmol/L), despite downtrending transaminases (aspartate transaminase of 32 U/L and alanine transaminase of 55 U/L). Results were also significant for macrocytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume 107/5), a low serum albumin of 2.3 g/dL, low serum protein of 4.1 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 122 U/L, total bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL, and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.65. Serum glucose and zinc levels were borderline low at 62 and 54 (normal range 56 – 134 μg/dL), respectively. The laboratory findings are further outlined in . Additionally, her plasma salicylate level, acetaminophen level, and urine toxicology were all negative. Despite a history of vitamin deficiencies, she was receiving chronic thiamine and vitamin B12 replacement at home, with normal values on admission. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) imaging of the head disclosed no evidence of acute infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass effect. The patient had no history of prior liver conditions or cirrhosis, and even though she presented elevation of transaminases and the INR, these abnormalities resolved once her condition improved. The patient had no other laboratory findings for compatible signs of cirrhosis (no thrombocytopenia or hyperbilirubinemia), neither physical stigmata suggestive of acute or chronic liver disease. Abdominal ultrasound was performed to further elucidate liver panel abnormalities and demonstrated only mild hepatic steatosis with no evidence of cirrhosis or ascites.\nShe was treated with supportive care and lactulose. The following day she had numerous bowel movements, and her serum ammonia level came down to 24 μmol/L.

The patient had also experienced urinary symptoms including frequency, urgency, gross hematuria, and dysuria for a month and had no history of any medical or surgical procedures prior to the visit. He was treated with antibiotics for 2 months under a diagnosis of cystitis and Meckel's diverticulum or Crohn's disease at local clinics; however, there were no pathologic findings on colonoscopy and no complaint about bowel symptoms. His family history was not notable for Crohn's disease.\nHe was 177 cm in height and 72 kg in weight with no acute distress. On physical examination, there were no abnormal findings. There was pyuria and microscopic hematuria on urine analysis; however, the other laboratory findings were within normal range. Cystoscopy showed diffuse erythematous mucosal thickening on the right side wall of the bladder dome (). However, there was no stool debridement no any fistulous opening in the bladder. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed that there was a tubular structure connected with the right side wall of the bladder, suggesting Meckel's diverticulum with fistula formation to the bladder as well as a mass-like bladder wall thickening ().\nWith an impression of Meckel's diverticulum with fistula with the bladder, a laparoscopic operation was performed through 3 abdominal ports (one 10 mm port placed at 10 mm above the umbilicus [camera] (KARL STORZ GmbH & Co. KG, Mittelstr, Tuttlingen, Germany), one 12 mm port for the right pararectal trocar, and one 5 mm port placed between the left anterior iliac spine and the umbilicus). The distal tip of the long appendix, which had a normal shape on its body and base was found to be densely adhered to the right side wall of the bladder (). Laparoscopic appendiceal ligation was performed with 10 mm Hem-O-Lok clips (Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) and 2-0 Vicryl (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA). After removing the proximal appendix, dissection of the bladder around the tip of the appendix was performed. There was a dense fibrotic change around the tip of the appendix. Partial cystectomy was performed and laparoscopic two-layered bladder repair was done with 3-0 Vicryl (Ethicon). The total surgical time was 75 minutes and the estimated intraoperative blood loss was minimal.\nOn the 7th postoperative day, cystography was performed and no urinary leakage around the bladder was demonstrated. The urinary symptoms including gross hematuria, dysuria, and frequency improved and abdominal discomfort symptoms also subsided. The other laboratory findings were within normal range. The surgical specimen showed a 9.2×1.2 cm appendix attached to a 4.3×3.2 cm bladder with dense fibrotic change without any malignancy.\nAt 1 month postoperatively, he had no symptoms including frequency, urgency, sense of residual urine, or intermittent gross hematuria. Nor were there any abnormal findings by CT which was performed 1 year postoperatively.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?\n\nIdeal Body Weight: IBW = base_weight + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60), where base_weight is 50 kg for men and 45.5 kg for women",

Her past medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, restrictive lung disease, morbid obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She had no history of cancer or multiple myeloma, or renal disease as evident from past admissions.\nUpon presentation to the ED, she was found to have a serum creatinine of 5 mg/dL (her baseline was 0.5 mg/dL) and a serum calcium level of 23.1 mg/dL (normal reference range: 8-10.4 mg/dL) and ionized calcium of 3.23 mg/dL (normal reference range: 4.23-5.11 mg/dL). Her albumin was 3.9 g/dL, within normal range, indicating true hypercalcemia. CT of her abdomen and pelvis revealed an 18 mm cyst in upper pole of the right kidney with a parapelvic cyst measuring 18 mm x 18 mm (Figure ). Chest X-ray (CXR), CT of head also did not show any significant pathology. Her other labs included a white blood cell (WBC) 14.14, hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, platelet 427,000 platelets per microliter, sodium 131 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, chloride 89 mEq/L, carbon dioxide 36 mEq/L (normal reference 20-32 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 62 mg/dL, magnesium 3 mEq/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 71 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 46 IU/L, troponin 39 ng/mL, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) 435 pg/mL, international normalized ratio (INR) less than 0, and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) more than 212 s. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) showed intraventricular right bundle branch block (Figure ). Her vitals included a temperature of 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse of 72 beats/min, and blood pressure of 160 over 83 millimeters of mercury. A hypercalcemia work-up was done which included parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related protein, and serum protein electrophoresis. PTH was found to be low at 13.9 pg/mL (normal range 15-75 pg/mL) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) was less than 2 pmol/L, normal. Serum immunofixation showed no monoclonal band, and serum and urine protein electrophoresis were unremarkable. Viral hepatitis serologies were negative. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was 3.14 uIU/mL, normal. Vitamin D 25-hydroxy was normal, 50.3 ng/mL.\nTreatment was initiated with fluid resuscitation (1 L normal saline bolus), the bisphosphonate Zometa (Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Schaumburg, IL), and Miacalcin (Mylan, Rockford, IL). A temporary dialysis catheter was placed and dialysis treatment was initiated 12 h later (day two), and again on day three due to a persistently elevated serum calcium level of 11.5 mg/dL. Dialysis was necessary as Zometa and Miacalcin were not working fast enough to ensure a positive outcome alone. In addition, there was concern for acute tubular necrosis due to Zometa in our patient with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min (Figures -, Table ).

He was treated with steroids and azithromycin. His kidney function stayed stable with average urine output of around 2 liters per 24 hours for the first 7 days of hospitalization. On the eighth day of hospitalization, he developed abrupt onset polyuria with an increase in urine output from 70-80 cc/hr. to 200-225 cc/hr., totaling approximately 5.4 L over the next 24 hr. Urine osmolality was 193 mOsm/kg H2O, while his random urine sodium also increased from 23 to 179 mmol per liter urine.\nThe cause was not immediately apparent. His medications included aspirin, albuterol, isosorbide mononitrate, amiodarone, lisinopril, and metoprolol. CT scan of the head was negative for any intracranial processes ruling out a pituitary lesion as the cause of central DI. The patient was not on any medication known to cause nephrogenic DI and serum electrolytes were within normal limits. The patient was euvolemic and had normal serum glucose, BUN, and other organic acid levels ruling out osmotic diuresis as the cause of polyuria. Renal ultrasound was negative for any obstruction. Pertinent labs included BUN 16 mg/dL, creatinine 0.65 mg/dL, glucose 130 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 3.6 mmol/L, and calcium 8.8 mg/dL. Urine electrolytes were sodium 179 mmol/L, potassium 14 mmol/L, chloride 25 mmol/L, creatinine 37 mg/dL, and lithium level <0.1 mmol/L.\nA thorough chart review identified that the patient had received dexmedetomidine due to worsening delirium at a rate of 0.2 mcg/kg/hr for a brief period, immediately before the abrupt onset of polyuria. No other instigating cause was identified; we suspected central DI secondary to dexmedetomidine. A DDAVP stimulation test was planned as a therapeutic challenge for central DI, but 48 hours after the cessation of dexmedetomidine, the urine output spontaneously decreased to 50-100 cc/hr and urine osmolality increased to 306 mOsm/kgH2O so the test was not done. His serum osmolality also normalized after that. The patient was not rechallenged with dexmedetomidine. At no time did the patient develop hypernatremia due to strict replacement of carefully calculated water losses.\nIn the light of extensive negative workup and temporal relationship of polyuria with dexmedetomidine infusion and resolution of the polyuria with drug abstinence, we concluded that the polyuria was secondary to transient central Diabetes Insipidus secondary to dexmedetomidine infusion. The Naranjo Score for dexmedetomidine induced polyuria for this patient was 8, thereby putting the medication in the probable likelihood of causing the adverse reaction of polyuria [].\n\nWhat is the patient's Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)?

She denied nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, bleeding, or clotting. The patient was a former smoker and did not drink alcohol. Her home medications included amlodipine, aspirin, cilostazol, cyanocobalamin, furosemide, metoprolol, pantoprazole, MVMs, potassium chloride tablets, and rosuvastatin. Her vitals were blood pressure: 144/63 mmHg, pulse: 89 beats/minute, respirations: 18/minute and temperature: 97.9ºF. On examination, she appeared healthy without obvious signs of distress. Her oropharynx was unremarkable for stomatitis, mucositis, or ulcerations. There was no jaundice. Neck was without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. Lungs were clear to auscultate. Cardiovascular auscultation showed normal cardiac sounds without murmur, gallop, or rub. Abdomen was soft, non-tender without visceromegaly. Cranial nerves were intact, and there were no sensory or motor deficits. Skin had normal turgor and showed no petechiae, bruises or rash. Her labs showed white blood cell count of 1.35 × 109/l (reference range (RR): 4.5–11.0 × 109), hemoglobin 7.1 gm/dl (RR: 12.3–15.3), hematocrit 22.4% (RR: 35.9–44.6), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 92 FL (RR: 80–96), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 31.7 g/dl (RR: 33.4–35.5) and platelet count of 99 × 109/l (RR: 150–400 × 109). The patient was severely neutropenic with an absolute neutrophilic count of 0.1 × 109/l (RR: 1.8–7.8 × 109). Sodium level was 137 mmol/l (RR: 135–145), potassium 3.3 mmol/l (RR: 3.7–5.2), creatinine 1.46 mg/dl (RR: 0.6–1.3), BUN 27 mg/dl (RR: 6–20), bicarbonate 28 mmol/l (RR: 23–29) and chloride 104 mmol/l (RR: 96–106). Thyroid functions were within normal range. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 106 U/l (RR: 8–33), Alanine transaminase (ALT) 102 U/l (RR: 4–36) and bilirubin 0.9 mg/dl (RR: 0.1–1.2). HIV, HBV, and HCV screens were negative. Vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal. Ultrasound abdomen was negative for hepatosplenomegaly. To rule out acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed mild megaloblastoid changes, mild myeloid shift and nonspecific dyshematopoeitic changes. Erythroid and myeloid precursors with vacuolization and megalobastoid changes are shown in . No ring sideroblasts were seen on bone marrow biopsy. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) study for MDS Panel (5/5q, 7/7q, 8, MLL, 20q) was normal.\nThe patient had history of macular degeneration and was taking MVMs for many years. For possible zinc-induced hypocupremia, we ordered serum zinc and serum copper levels. Zinc level was 168 ug/dl (RR: 60–130) and the copper level was <10 ug/l (RR: 810–1990). MVMs containing 80 mg of zinc (this MVMs contained 2 mg of copper as well but apparently dose was not sufficient enough to compensate for zinc excess) was discontinued and the patient was started on oral copper 8 mg daily. With the two-week treatment of oral copper, the patient’s white blood cell count improved from 1.35 to 7.13 × 109/l, hemoglobin from 7.1 to 9.8 g/dl and platelet from 99 to 216 × 109/l.

On the postnatal day six, a distended abdomen was noticed and baby was admitted to another hospital for investigations. On abdominal examination firm mass was palpable. The liver was occupying the entire abdomen. The patient also had edema of the lower extremities and mild respiratory distress.\nInitial laboratory findings including complete blood count (hemoglobin: 14.6 g/dl, white blood count: 22,800 /l, platelet count: 330,000/l), electrolytes and renal function tests were within normal range. Alanine aminotransferase level (19 U/l, N: <45 U/l) was normal. However aspartate aminotransferase (85 U/l, N: <41 U/l), gamma glutamyl transferase (238 U/l, N: 8-61 U/l) and total/direct bilirubin levels (3/1.6 mg/dl, N: <1.1/<0.3 mg/dl) were high. Serological evaluation for toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Epstein–Barr virus and parvovirus were all negative. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) revealed hepatomegaly with a heterogeneous liver parenchyma and a 39x31 mm hypo-echoic solitary non-calcified mass in the right adrenal region. A computed tomography scan revealed a right adrenal soft tissue mass (4.8x3.6 cm) with no calcification and contrast uptake, and significant hepatomegaly. The spleen appeared to be in normal size but was replaced inferiorly because of the massive hepatomegaly. Serum neuron-specific enolase level was higher, 60 ng/mL (normal range: <10 ng/mL), and alpha feto protein level (22754 ng/mL, N: >45000 ng/mL at birth) was normal. Urine vanillylmandelic acid and serum ferritin levels were 5718 mg/day (N: 0.5-2 mg/day) and 531 ng/mL (N: 24-336 ng/mL) retrospectively. Bone marrow aspiration revealed no malignant infiltration, no rosette forming and no storage cells. On the postnatal day eighteen, doppler USG showed decreased flow in the IVC, secondary to compression. Based on clinical presentation and imaging modalities, the presumptive diagnosis of NBL was made and the case was referred to our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on the postnatal day twenty.\nOn admission to our NICU, he had respiratory distress with 40% O2 requirement and significant abdominal distension with visible thin venous vessels through his abdominal skin (Fig. 1a). He had tachypnea besides edema of lower extremities, scrotum and penile area. Complete blood count revealed anemia (hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dl), leukocytosis (33.300 /l) and mild thrombocytosis (536.000/l). Serum sodium (128 mEq/l), chloride (94 mEq/l), calcium (7 mg/dl) and phosphorus (0.7 mg/dl) concentrations were low. Serum uric acid and renal function tests revealed normal results (uric acid: 5.8 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen: 9 mg/dl, creatinine: 0.43 mg/dl). Liver function tests revealed cholestasis (alanine aminotransferase: 40 U/l, aspartate aminotransferase: 101 U/l, γ-glutamyltransferase: 463 U/l, total/direct bilirubin: 3.05/2.02 mg/dl) and hypoproteinemia (total protein: 3.4 g/dl and albumin: 1.8 g/dl). Clotting studies demonstrated prolonged prothrombin time (PT) as 16 seconds (N: 9.4 to 12.5 seconds) and low fibrinogen level (0.89 g/dl, N: 2.38–4.98).\nSecond abdominal USG evaluation showed right suprarenal mass which was about 5 cm in diameter, severely diffuse hepatomegaly and ascites. After pediatric oncology consultation, the patient underwent hydration, chemotherapy and allopurinol treatments between the postnatal days 20–23. The patient received modified VEC (vincristine, etoposide, carboplatin) protocol due to poor clinical condition. In spite of the received chemotherapy, his clinical condition worsened progressively. The abdominal distention was so increased that he required high frequency oscillatory ventilation support. However, he did not develop signs of tumor lysis syndrome. The patient was accepted as chemotherapy-resistant NBL due to clinical deterioration with massive liver involvement on the 3rd day of treatment and surgical excision was performed (Fig. 1b, 1c). Pathology revealed intra-adrenal tumor with wide-spread expression of bcl 2 in addition to distant metastases in the liver and minimal lymphocytic infiltration. MYC-N amplification obtained from adrenal specimen revealed <3 copies. IVC compression directly observed during the surgery resulted in severe circulation collapse and the patient died due to hypotensive shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation just two hours after the operation.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

About two years prior to his initial clinic visit, he reportedLy had an episode of jaundice after taking terbinafine, but it had resolved spontaneously after three months. He denied any recent use of prescription medication, herbal medication, alcohol or illicit drugs. There was no family history of recurrent cholestatic disorder or liver disease. Physical examination was significant for marked jaundice and scleral icterus but there was neither sign nor stigmata of chronic liver disease. Laboratory tests showed white blood count 3300/μL, hemoglobin 13 g/dL, platelets 186 000/μL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 91 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 96 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 712 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 643 U/L, total bilirubin 2.4 mg/dL, albumin 4.3 g/dL, total protein 7.7 g/dL, international normalized ratio 1 and creatinine 1.1. Hepatitis A, B and C serology was negative. Iron studies, ceruloplasmin, alpha 1-anitrypsin, serum immunoglobulins and protein electrophoresis were normal. Anti-nuclear (ANA), anti-smooth muscle, anti-mitochondrial (AMA) and anti-liver-kidney microsome antibodies were negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilation or cholelithiasis. Magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) revealed normal pancreatic duct, common hepatic duct, common bile duct without ductal dilation and normal liver. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy did not show evidence of inflammatory bowel disease. Further work-up with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed normal pancreatic and biliary system, without evidence of any large- or small-duct disease (). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 600 mg daily was administered for his symptomatic cholestasis. In six-month and one-year follow-up visits, there was no improvement in his liver enzymes (); however, his liver synthetic function remained intact and there was no evidence of hepatic decompensation. Given persistent elevation of liver enzymes, percutaneous liver biopsy was performed in 2013. This demonstrated chronic biliary disease with duct injury, duct loss in at least 4 out of 15 portal tracts, prominent cholestasis and mild periportal fibrosis (). Work-up for sarcoidosis showed normal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level, while mediastinal lymph node biopsy was unrevealing.\nThree months later, the patient was admitted to the hospital for worsening jaundice and pruritus. His liver enzymes were elevated to ALT 167 U/L, AST 221 U/L, ALP 1726 U/L and total bilirubin 14.9 mg/dL. MRCP revealed under-distended, poorly visualized intrahepatic ducts and non-dilated common bile duct. Subsequent ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy demonstrated normal cholangiogram with minimal narrowing of the intrahepatic ducts, without evidence of changes. On discharge, his liver enzymes improved to ALT 39 U/L, AST 40 U/L, ALP 637 U/L, total bilirubin 10.8 mg/dL, and UDCA was increased to 1200 mg daily. In subsequent clinic visits, his liver enzymes were found to be persistently elevated to ALP 1500–2000 U/L and total bilirubin 20–30 mg/dL, without any clinical signs of hepatic decompensation ().\nLeading differential diagnoses were small biliary duct etiologies including AMA-negative primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and idiopathic adulthood ductopenia (IAD). However, the patient's gender was unusual for PBC, while extreme elevation of bilirubin and ALP without concomitant liver failure was not consistent with PSC and PBC. In addition, he did not respond to empirical treatment for autoimmune cholangiopathy, and had a negative sarcoidosis work-up. Furthermore, his age of onset and benign family medical history made hereditary disorders, such as benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis or progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, less likely.

Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly.

Fifteen years after the last episode of pancreatitis, she presented with alopecia, malar rash, and oral ulcers. She was initially diagnosed as having discoid lupus with the skin biopsy results. However, a week later, she developed severe neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE, including focal motor seizures, with a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score of 18 points. Rheumatologists prescribed methylprednisolone (three doses of 1 g daily by intravenous injection) with improvement of neurological symptoms. Her treatment at hospital discharge was: chloroquine (225 mg/day), levetiracetam (1.5 g twice a day), phenytoin (100 mg twice a day), lorazepam (1 mg/day), and a monthly bolus of CY. In addition, she was treated with weekly down-titrating doses of prednisone (initial dose of 1 mg/kg).\nSeven days after administration of the sixth dose of CY (cumulative dose of 6.25 g), she presented with asthenia, adynamia, polydipsia, nausea and vomiting, food intolerance, impaired visual acuity, and abdominal pain. The physical examination at our ED revealed tachycardia (125 beats per minute), tachypnea (27 breaths per minute), drowsiness, and dehydration. She presented with a normal body mass index and no stigmata associated with insulin resistance. Laboratory tests reported: serum glucose of 1240 mg/dl, sodium of 127 mEq/L, potassium of 5.56 mEq/L, chlorine of 86 mEq/L, arterial pH of 7.07, bicarbonate of 3.00 mmol/L, and ketonuria (80 mg/dl) with effective serum osmolarity of 322.8 mOsm/kg and total osmolarity of 334.1 mOsm/kg, with an anion gap of 43.56, urea 63 mg/dl, and creatinine of 1.58 mg/dl. Liver tests, amylase, and lipase were normal. After the diagnosis of a mixed hyperglycemic state with predominance of severe DKA, she was started on an aggressive intravenously administered fluid schedule with saline solution 0.9% and intravenous continuous insulin infusion (CII). During the first day she required a total of 165 units of insulin per day (2.75 U/kg per day). Table shows the clinical and biochemical evolution from first evaluation to resolution of DKA.\nDuring the first hours, traditional precipitant factors for DKA, such as infections or cardiac ischemia were ruled out. With an aliquot from the first serum sample in the ED, we measured anti-insulin, anti-GAD65, and anti-IA2 antibodies that were reported as negative; C-peptide was determined to be 0.5 ng/ml and the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 12.0%. The diagnostic consideration was of T1DM, so once DKA remission was achieved, she was prescribed an intensive insulin scheme at a dose of 1.09 IU/kg per day with 70% of basal insulin glargine daily and 30% of lispro boluses divided in three doses.\nWith the multi-drug immunosuppressive treatment her symptoms improved and 3 months after discharge the CY was switched to azathioprine and then to chloroquine. Three weeks after the switch from CY to other immunosuppressive therapies, she presented with symptomatic hypoglycemia and insulin doses were tapered down. Five months after the switch, insulin was completely withdrawn. At last follow up, 1 year after the hyperglycemic crisis, she had no symptoms related to hyperglycemia and her blood glucose remains under 100 mg/dl. She continues to have a well-balanced, low-carbohydrate diet and her last HbA1c was 5.2% and C-peptide was 1.8 ng/ml without any antidiabetic drugs.\n\nWhat is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?\n\nSodium Correction for Hyperglycemia: correction = Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100)",

She had been diagnosed with hypertension 20 years previously and diabetes mellitus 10 years later, for which she was taking oral medications consisting of olmesartan medoxomil 40mg qd, aspirin 100mg qd, vildagliptin 50mg qd and atorvastatin 10mg qd; the antihypertensive agent was changed to olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg qd 1 month before presentation.\nOn arrival, the patient's vital signs were stable, and physical, neurological and radiological examinations were within normal limits with the exception of a decrease in skin turgor. Initial laboratory results were as follows: WBC 6,160/mm3, Hb 12.3 g/dL, Hct 35.6%, and Platelet 302,000/mm3; Na 115 mmol/L, K 3.9 mmol/L, Cl 83 mmol/L, uric acid 10.0 mg/dL, BUN 15 mg/dL, creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, and serum osmolality 247 mOsm/kg H2O; and urine creatinine 65 mg/dL, urine urea nitrogen 620 mg/dL, urine Na 74 mmol/L, and urine osmolarity 596 mOsm/kg H2O. The patient's blood sugar was 118 mg/dL, and the HbA1c level was 7.6%. Thyroid function test and rapid ACTH stimulation test results were within normal range.\nInitial blood tests revealed the presence of hyponatremia with a Na level of 115 mmol/L; blood sugar was 118 mg/dL with serum and urine osmolality at 247 mOsm/kg H2O and 596 mOsm/kg H2O, respectively, upon which the possibility of hyperglycemia-induced pseudohyponatremia and hyponatremia caused by polydipsia was ruled out. The hypovolemic state and a high urine sodium concentration of 74 mmol/L implied the presence of sodium loss through the kidneys. Endocrine test results revealed no evidence of hypoaldosteronism. The absence of recent vomiting led to the diagnosis of drug-induced hyponatremia.\nWe initiated treatment for hyponatremia with alteration of the current antihypertensive regimen to olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg qd, in addition to a continuous intravenous infusion of 0.9% NaCl. On the following day, the patient's laboratory test results improved to Na 125 mmol/L, serum osmolality 270 mOsm/kg H2O, urine osmolality 352 mOsm/kg H2O, and urine Na 39 mmol/L. On the second day of admission, 0.9% NaCl infusion was discontinued as we continued observation of the patient. By simply adjusting the antihypertensive regimen, the serum Na level improved substantially to 135 mmol/L, while the patient's blood pressure continued to be under control at 120/80 mmHg.

On arrival at the emergency room, his blood pressure, pulse and respiration were 90/60 mm Hg, 130/minute and 24/minute, respectively. His body temperature was 36.8℃ and he was clearly conscious. On auscultation of the chest, crackles were heard in both lower lungs. Heart sounds showed rapid pulse and no murmur. Interstitial pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly were observed from his chest X-ray, while his electrocardiography revealed findings of ST-depression in the V 3, V 4 and V 5 areas. The peripheral blood test revealed WBC 14100/uL, Hb 14.0 g/dL and platelet 465000/uL. Serobiochemical studies showed blood urea nitrogen 14.6 mg/dL, creatinine 1.2 mg/dL and hyperlipidemia was shown with total cholesterol of 210 mg/dL, triglyceride 97 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 37 mg/dL and low density lipoprotein 177mg/dL. An immunochemical serologic test revealed a finding of inflammation with high sensitivity C-reactive protein 2.56 mg/dL. CK, creatine kinase-MB and troponin-I were all negative, while the level of D-dimer was measured to be high at 5408 ng/mL. The results of arterial blood gas analysis while the patient was on O2 mask 5 L (approximately FiO2 0.4) showed hypoxemia with pH 7.24, PCO2 28 mm Hg, PO2 62 mm Hg, bicarbonate 27 mmol/L and O2 saturation of 90%. Increased right ventricular size, decreased right ventricular function and D-shaped left ventricle were observed in the echocardiography. With a suspicion of possible pulmonary thromboembolism, contrast enhanced chest computed tomography was carried out, which revealed multiple thromboembolism in the main, lobar, segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries of both lungs (). The patient's O2 saturation dropped to 90-91% even with an O2 mask of 7 L (approximately FiO2 0.6). Owing to observations of persistent hypotension of 80/40 mm Hg despite hemodynamic support, thrombolytic therapy (Actilyse®-alteplase: 100 mg over 2 hours) was performed. Lower extremity vascular computed tomography was carried out to find the origin of venous thromboembolism. This revealed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the distal portion of the left popliteal vein (). The patient underwent anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin (Clexane®-enoxaparin: 60 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours for 7 days) and warfarin. Having observed venous thromboembolism at a young age, a screening test for immunologic diseases was carried out to make the differential diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. The findings of complement levels (C3, C4), antinuclear antibody (ANA), antibody to anti-double-stranded DNA, anticardiolipin antibody of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG, as well as lupus anticoagulant and venereal disease research laboratory test were all negative. The follow-up chest computed tomography performed ten (10) days after hospital admission did not show pulmonary thromboembolism.

The patient had been in his usual state of health, until he told his family 3 hours before that he “felt sick.” The family incidentally found him on the floor, confused and lethargic, and immediately called the ambulance.\nUpon arrival, the patient had a temperature of 96.4°F; pulse, 117 beats per minute; blood pressure, 151/93 mmHg; respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation of 100% on nonrebreather. The patient was known to have a history of recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, and his last episode of hepatic encephalopathy was in the prior 3 months, which was treated and controlled with lactulose. The patient's family stated that the patient had run out of lactulose 4 days before presentation. Other than lactulose, the patient was compliant with all of his home medications, including amlodipine, buproprion, cyclosporine, hydrocodone, lasix, methocarbamol, and ramipril. The patient had no known history of seizure, recent illness, brain trauma, or recent surgical procedures.\nPhysical examination showed a male in no acute distress with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 12 (eyes, 4; verbal, 3; motor, 5). There were no signs of trauma found on his body. His pupils were equally round and reactive to light, and his neck was supple and soft with a cervical collar in place. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable except for tachycardia. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Because he was not following commands, the neurologic examination was limited. However, the patient was able to move all extremities equally and pulses were distally equal to all extremities. There was no posturing or clonus noted, and Babinski was downgoing in both feet.\nFingerstick glucose level was 210 mg/dL and bedside hemoglobin level was 13.1 g/dL. Noncontrast head and cervical spine computed tomography revealed no acute pathologic lesion. Chest radiography also showed no acute pathologic lesion. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell counts of 5.5 K/mm3 with 60% neutrophils, hematocrit of 36.5%, and platelets of 115 K/mm3. Electrolyte and liver function results were as follows: sodium, 141 mmol/L; potassium, 3.5 mmol/L; chloride, 104 mmol/L; bicarbonate, 22 mmol/L; calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 71 mmol/L; creatinine, 1.9 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 2.1 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 128 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 124 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 231 U/L; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; lipase, 30 U/L; prothrombin time, 14.5 seconds; INR, 1.09; and ammonia, 501 μmol/L (reference range, 15–55 μmol/L). Toxicology serum screen results were negative for acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol. Urine toxicology screen results were positive only for opiates. Venous blood gas was pH 7.44.\nOwing to the patient's obtunded condition and inability to protect his airway, the patient was electively intubated and given midazolam drip for sedation. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring with a presumed diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. While administration of empiric antibiotics was started in the emergency department, it was discontinued after an infectious etiology was deemed unlikely and culture results were negative. Results of a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan were also negative, including no evidence of infarct.\nDuring the ICU stay, the patient was readministered lactulose, and ammonia levels decreased to117 μmol/L by hospital day 2 and to 78 μmol/L by hospital day 4. Despite discontinuation of sedation, the patient remained unresponsive. A neurologist was consulted and a bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed findings consistent with status epilepticus. However, the patient had no clinical manifestations of status epilepticus, leading to a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. A phenytoin load was immediately administered, while a midazolam infusion was restarted, ultimately leading to EEG resolution of the status epilepticus.

On routine checkup, his blood test results were as follows: fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 555 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 2.29 mg/dL; serum sodium, 140 mmol/L; serum triglycerides, 792 mg/dL; glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 14.9%. Review of his medical history revealed that he had high FPG levels 1 year prior to the consult during a routine checkup. Treatment had been recommended, but he did not undergo further workup. Our patient was immediately started on oral hypoglycemic agents and was referred to the department of ophthalmology for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy.\nOn ophthalmic examination, his uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was 20/200 and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in both eyes. He had mild myopia, with -3.25 diopters (D) of spherical equivalent in both eyes, which was the same as his own glasses. The lenses were clear in both eyes and the remainder of the ophthalmic examination findings were normal.\nThree days after the first visit, our patient presented with a sudden decrease in visual acuity and glare in both eyes that had begun 2 days prior to consult. Metformin hydrochloride (Glycomin tablet) 500 mg twice a day was prescribed. However, his blood glucose level was not optimally controlled, so he was prescribed insulin with titration. On the day he was treated with insulin and his blood glucose level began to be controlled, he felt an abrupt decrease in his visual acuity. His BCVA was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. A dilated slit-lamp examination showed fine feathery snowflake opacities in the posterior subcapsular region of bilateral lenses (Fig. ). Dilated fundus examination revealed some exudates and cotton wool patches from the macula to the mid-periphery region. Repeated blood test results on the same day showed a rapid decrease in FPG, which decreased to 214 mg/dL.

Muffled heart sounds without fine crackle were also detected.\nThe initial results of laboratory tests (Table ) were as follows: BUN 19.0 (7–23) mg/dL, creatinine 1.5 (0.7–1.4) mg/dL, creatine kinase 9300 (43–198) IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 1876 (238–422) IU/L, myoglobulin 636 (28–72) ng/mL, alanine aminotransferase 357 (3–45) IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase 278 (3–45) IU/L, creatine kinase muscle-brain fraction (CK-MB) 52.07 (0–4.87) U/L, troponin I 0.057 (0–0.014) ng/mL, total cholesterol 222 (130–240) mg/dL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) 136 (50–160) mg/dL, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) 74 (40–85) mg/dL, and triglycerides 127 (35–200) mg/dL. The results of thyroid function tests showed TSH > 100 (0.17–4.05) μIU/mL, fT4 0.32 (0.89–1.79) μIU/mL, and triiodothyronine (T3) 55.6 (78–182) ng/dL. On chest radiography, heart shadow was not blunted without pulmonary infiltration, and cardiomegaly was seen (cardiothoracic ratio, 66%; Fig. a). An electrocardiogram showed bradycardia with normal sinus rhythm and low QRS voltage, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a moderate amount of pericardial effusion (posterior 15 mm) with preserved left ventricular systolic function (55–60%; Fig. c). On further investigation, pure tone audiometry revealed that the patient had profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (Fig. a), and thyroid sonography showed diffusely enlarged gland with a heterogeneous echotexture and decreased vascularity (Fig. ); these findings are consistent with Hashimoto thyroiditis together with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies (> 2000 [0–5.61] IU/mL) and antithyroglobulin antibodies (9143.72 [0–4.11] IU/mL).\nUpon admission, we started aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation to treat rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury and levothyroxine replacement (oral, 150 mcg/day) to treat hypothyroidism. We also started systemic corticosteroids and intratympanic steroid injection to treat sensorineural hearing loss. The patient did not require pericardiocentesis because there was no ventricular dysfunction, and his vital signs were comparatively stable. Over the next several days, the patient’s clinical symptoms, such as shortness of breath, general weakness, and lower limb discomfort, improved substantially. On consecutive laboratory tests, creatine kinase as well as lactate dehydrogenase began to decrease on hospital day (HD) 3 and continued to decline to 1530 IU/L and 1508 IU/L on HD 7, respectively. Creatinine also started to decrease by 1.11 mg/dL on HD 7 accompanied by creatine kinase decline. Further thyroid function testing showed that his TSH was 53.65 μIU/mL and fT4 was 0.63 μIU/mL on HD 7. The patient was discharged home on HD 10 with instructions to continue levothyroxine (150 mcg/day, oral).\nThe patient was examined in the outpatient clinic 2 weeks after discharge. We observed recovered creatinine and creatinine kinase (Table ) as well as improved cardiomegaly (Fig. b). Except for hearing loss, his clinical symptoms continued to improve, and he was compliant with levothyroxine treatment. His thyroid function was normalized at 5 months (TSH 0.10 μIU/mL, free T4 1.60 μIU/mL) and remained euthyroid status until one year after discharge (TSH 0.54 μIU/mL, free T4 1.52 μIU/mL). No pericardial effusion appeared on transthoracic echocardiography (Fig. d). Regarding hearing loss, there was slight improvement in follow-up pure tone audiometry after 1 year; nevertheless, profound unilateral hearing loss remained in this patient (Fig. b).\n\nWhat is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?\n\nFramingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease: For men, risk_score = 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not, and if age is greater than 70, the age variable is set to 70 within the 'age' term for the β x ln(Age) x Smoker term.

            "input": "The patient analyzed is a 14-year-old boy affected by severe AIS. He was recruited for the study in a tertiary outpatient clinical center specializing in conservative treatment of spinal disorders. The patient presented two primary curves, a right thoracic curve (60° Cobb angle) and left lumbar curve (63° Cobb angle) (). He was 170 cm and 70 kg (Body Mass Index (BMI): 24.22; Tri-Ponderal Mass Index (TMI) []: 14.25). Aesthetic impairment was observed as he obtained a score of 51.1 at the TRACE test in the recently developed Rasch version [] (). Radiological parameters of the curves, both in brace and out brace, are described in . In-brace spine x-ray is shown in .\nThe patient had come to our attention with a prescription of a rigid brace (Lyonese) 23 hours per day; nevertheless, self-reported compliance was just 8 to 10 hours per day. Because of the severity of the curves that well exceeded threshold for surgery consideration (63°), surgical treatment was advised; however, the patient refused surgery. For this reason, a very rigid brace (Sforzesco) was prescribed 23 hours per day. A thermic sensor was applied (Thermobrace) in order to objectively verify compliance [].\n: The present case report adheres to the CARE (CAse REporting) structure and reporting Guidelines []. The present study is a case study with a prospective observational design. Additional and non-invasive procedures have been used, i.e. actigraphy. The subject’s rest-activity data were recorded for one consecutive week, at home, through an accelerometer, in the last week of July 2018; that period of the season was the holiday period for the subject, with no school commitments. The period coincided with the first days of Sforzesco brace wear 23 hours per day. The study protocol was conducted in accordance with the current national and international laws and regulations governing the use of human subjects (Declaration of Helsinki II). The subject, before the beginning of the study, signed an informed consent that explained the study protocol highlighting its benefits and possible risks.\n: Actigraphy is widely used to study insomnia, sleep and rest-activity circadian rhythms disorders [,]; it represents a valid and practical tool that is extremely less invasive than the traditional polysomnography (PSG). An actigraph recording can be performed at home without hospitalization, lasting for many consecutive weeks []. It was also shown that the circadian period of the actigraph-defined sleep/wake rhythm accurately predicted the period of the PSG-defined activity-rest cycle [].\nRAR was recorded using an the Actiwatch 2 actigraph (Philips Respironics, OR, USA). The device is composed by a piezoelectric triaxial accelerometer able to convert axial movements over time in electrical signals. The subject’s activity counts (AC) were recorded 24 hours/day for one week, i.e. seven consecutive days, from Monday to Sunday. The ACs data were transferred from actigraph to a PC with the use of the Philips Actiware 6 Software (Philips Respironics, OR, USA) and then exported and analyzed, epoch per epoch (1 epoch = 60 seconds), in an Excel working sheet (Microsoft Corporation, WA, USA) before performing the rhythmometric analysis (see statistical analysis for details).\n: To determine the existence of RAR for each single day and for the week of monitoring, the ACs were analyzed using the single and the population mean cosinor method respectively [,]. Both methods studies the cosine mathematical function that best fits the data as a function of time and they describe three specific rhythmometric parameters: MESOR, the Midline Estimating Statistic of Rhythm; A, the amplitude; and Φ, the acrophase. The MESOR is a rhythm-adjusted mean for a 24-h period, A is the measure of one half the extent of the rhythmic variation in a cycle, and Φ indicates the time interval within which the highest values are observed. The three parameters are reported with the relevant 95% confidence intervals (CI) (). The statistical rhythmometric analyses were carried out using the Time Series Analysis Serial Cosinor 6.3 (Expert Soft Technology, Richelieu, France). Significance was set at p < 0.05.\n: In parallel with RAR monitoring, sleep parameters were also objectively monitored for seven consecutive nights with the same actigraph (Philips Respironics, OR, USA). The Actiwatch 2 is a widely used actigraph worn on the non-dominant wrist that has the capability to determine both RARs but also sleep parameters [] and it has been validated against PSG in healthy children and adults []. It is however important to underline that sleep parameters can be derived from Actiwatch 2 recordings using three different threshold settings (low, medium, or high) for detection of movements. The threshold settings use different magnitudes of activity for discriminating sleep and wake states, and thus affect the sleep parameters derived from the actigraph. Therefore, in the present case study, a low actigraphic sensitivity threshold (80 counts per epoch) was selected since this cut-off value seems to provide the best combination of sensitivity and specificity in young subjects [,].\nTen sleep parameters were measured:\nI) Sleep Start (SS): the start of sleep was derived automatically using the Actiwatch 2 algorithm; it is expressed in hours and minutes (hh:mm);\nII) Sleep End (SEnd): the end of sleep was derived automatically using the Sleepwatch algorithm; it is expressed in hours and minutes (hh:mm);\nIII) Time in Bed (TB): the difference between SS and Send, expressed in minutes;\nIV) Sleep Latency (SL): the period of time, in minutes, between bedtime and sleep onset time;\nV) Sleep Efficiency (SE): the percentage of time in bed actually spent sleeping;\nVI) Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO), the amount of time spent awake after sleep has been initiated; WASO is typically expressed in minutes;\nVII) Total Sleep Time (TST), the amount of sleep, expressed both in minutes and percentage, obtained during a sleep period;\nVIII) Immobility Time (IT), the total time, expressed both in percentage and minutes, spent without recording any movement during time in bed;\nIX) Mobility Time (MT), the total time, expressed both in percentage and minutes, spent recording significant movement during time in bed;\nX) Fragmentation Index (FI), the sum of the percentages of mobility and immobility accesses in one minute, divided by the number of immobility accesses. FI is expressed in percentage.\nThe data are reported as mean±SD. Together with the actigraph, the study subject received a sleep diary to record bed time, wake up time, the number of nocturnal awakenings, or the time spent without wearing the device.\n: The sensor applied showed a very good compliance to treatment in the period analyzed with an objectively reported compliance of 22.8 hours per day.\n: The single cosinor method revealed the presence of a statistically significant RAR for each single day (p < 0.001). Similarly, the population mean cosinor applied to total data of the seven days of monitoring, revealed the presence of a significant RAR (p < 0.001); specifically: the percentage of rhythm was 23.4%, the mean MESOR was 84.6 ACs, the amplitude registered a mean value of 74.4 ACs and the acrophase occurred at 17:56 h. reports the rhythmometric parameters of RAR and shows graphically the rhythm.\n: and report both the raw data and the mean±SD of all sleep parameters. The subject showed a large variability in all ten parameters with a large gap between minimum and maximum values. For instance: SL ranged from 0 to 89 minutes with a mean value of 25.9 ± 35.9 minutes and, similarly, FI ranged from 11.3% to 43.2% with a mean value of 27.3 ± 12.8%. In general, the subject reached a good sleep quantity: 507.9 ± 30.2 minutes of TB with a mean TST of 450.7 ± 20.1 minutes, corresponding to the 88.9 ± 4.3% of time spent sleeping; on the contrary, as expected, sleep quality, although not bad, was not excellent: SE was equal to 83.3 ± 7.2%, mean WASO value was 57.1 ± 24.6 minute, and IT registered a mean value of 86.3 ± 4.4%. It is also important to note that sleep timing, i.e. SS and SEnd, showed an expected marked delay: on average, the subject started to sleep at 01:36 ± 01:02 h and woke up at 09:55 ± 00:40 h.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

The patient had an elevated blood pressure of 130/79 mmHg, pulse rate of 98 beats/min, and respiration rate of 30 breaths/min at the time of admission; his body temperature was 35.4℃. He showed signs of acute illness and presented with lethargic consciousness and restlessness. No other specific findings were found. The venous blood gas analysis results showed pH 6.90, PaCO2 34 mmHg, PaO2 25 mmHg, bicarbonate 6.7 mmol/L, base excess −26.1 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation 15%. Serum biochemical analysis showed sodium 136.4 mEq/L, potassium 7.80 mEq/L, chloride 110 mEq/L, calcium 9.9 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.2 mg/dL, glucose 125 mg/dL, osmolality 375 mOsmol/kg, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.67 mg/dL. The patient also showed signs of high anion gap metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 19.7 mmol/L and osmolar gap of 91.34 mOsm/kg H20. Urinalysis showed proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Electrocardiogram findings showed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 134 beats/min, whereas chest radiography showed mild pulmonary edema. Fluid replacement, sodium bicarbonate, and thiamine were administered as the initial treatment, and fomepizole was loaded at 15 mg/kg intravenously and administered four times, each at 10 mg/kg in 12-h intervals. One hour after admission, the patient's consciousness deteriorated from lethargy to stupor, necessitating tracheal intubation. Two hours after admission, overall condition deteriorated and acidosis was not corrected. Consequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit, where continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated. Thirty hours after dialysis, metabolic acidosis was controlled, as indicated by pH 7.46, PaCO2 36 mmHg, PaO2 106 mmHg, HCO3 25.6 mEq/L, and anion gap 5.9 mmol/L (). His vital signs stabilized on the 6th day of admission, and consequently, he was extubated. However, the patient's levels of BUN and creatinine remained elevated at 39 and 4.28 mg/dL, respectively, and his hourly urine output was only 10–30 mL, and calcium oxalate crystals were detected on urine microscopy (). The patient's acute renal failure persisted, and therefore the treatment was switched to routine hemodialysis, maintained at three rounds every other day. Starting from the 12th day of admission and the start of dialysis, daily urine output increased to >1,000 mL; thus, dialysis was discontinued. On the 23rd day of admission, the serum BUN/creatinine level decreased to 18.4/1.73 mg/dL, and the daily urine output was being maintained at 3000–4000 mL. The patient was discharged and monitored through Follow-ups.

The patient had been suffering dyspnea on exertion for three years. His vital signs were blood pressure (BP) 130–150/70–80 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 80–100 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) 18–22 rates/min, and body temperature 36.2℃. The patient's oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2) while receiving air was 75–89%, which was partially corrected to 91–98% while receiving 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal prong (VNP). Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) under oxygen administration revealed the following: pH 7.39, arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) 44.6 mmHg, arterial O2 partial pressure(PaO2) 65.3 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3–) 26.1 mEq/L.\nDuring induction, both mask ventilation and intubation were difficult (laryngeal view: Cormack-Lehane grade IV). Intubation trials with a 37-Fr. left-sided double lumen tube (DLT) (Mallinckrodt™, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) and laryngoscopy, followed by a videostylet (Optiscope®, Pacific Medical, Seoul, Korea) failed. Hence, a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was used to intubate a single lumen tube (SLT) (ID 8.0), and then the SLT was changed to a DLT using a tube exchanger.\nLeft one-lung ventilation (OLV) was maintained with an SpO2 of 86–90% at an inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2) of 1.0 during right-lung lavage. We performed external percussion physiotherapy with an automatic mechanical percussion device (The Vest™ Model 205 [Airway Clearance System], frequency 10 Hz, duration 3 minutes, Hill-Rom, Charleston, SC, USA) rather than manual chest percussion. After right-lung lavage, we resumed two-lung ventilation (TLV) with intermittent suction for 20 minutes (FIO2 1.0). For left-lung lavage, right OLV was started with an FIO2 of 1.0, but it was impossible to maintain SpO2 > 80% (). Therefore, we decided to postpone left-lung lavage until conditions in the right lung improved (). A chest X-ray taken after intensive care unit (ICU) transfer showed no specific findings, including pneumothorax. One day after the lavage, while in the ICU, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation, extubated, and transferred to the general ward.\nThree days later, the patient was returned to the operating room for left-lung lavage. The patient's SpO2 was 91–96% with O2 3 L/min VNP. We intubated the trachea with a SLT via Glide-Scope (Verathon Medical, British Columbia, Canada) and then changed the SLT to a DLT with a tube exchanger because the previous intubation was difficult. We confirmed breath sounds from both lungs, and right and left lung ventilation during separation through auscultation. The proper tube location was confirmed using an FOB.\nTLV was performed in volume-controlled mode: FIO2 1.0, tidal volume of 400 ml, RR of 15 rates/min, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 31 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. PaO2 was 57 mmHg (SpO2 86%) on ABGA examination. Fifty minutes after induction, we started right OLV in pressure-controlled mode: FIO2 1.0, inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O above PEEP 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 200 ml, and RR of 20 /min. Within a few minutes of starting right OLV, the patient's SpO2 plunged below 80%, so we rapidly resumed TLV and re-confirmed the proper position of the DLT using an FOB. We did not observe any bronchial secretion or obstruction. Right OLV was tried again, but the patient's SpO2 rapidly decreased to < 80% within a few minutes. After resuming TLV, 2.5 mg of salbutamol was nebulized to relieve any bronchial constriction, and 100 mg of hydrocortisone was injected intravenously to improve symptoms. During manual ventilation, we detected very poor lung compliance. In auscultation, the patient's breath sounds from the right lung were very distant and nearly inaudible. Therefore, we suspected he had a right-side pneumothorax, which was confirmed on chest X-ray (). A chest tube was inserted by a thoracic surgeon, and a follow-up chest X-ray showed that the pneumothorax had decreased (). Two hours after induction, lung compliance and arterial oxygenation improved: FIO2 1.0, tidal volume of 450 ml, RR of 18/min, PIP of 24 cmH2O, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. PaO2 improved to 93 mmHg on the following ABGA examination ().\nWe re-tried right OLV and were finally able to maintain SpO2 > 90%: FIO2 1.0, inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O above PEEP 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 320 ml, and RR of 20 /min, without any severe air leakage or tidal-volume loss. The left-lung lavage was started along with right OLV with the chest tube inserted state. During the remaining lavage period, we maintained SpO2 > 85% without further deterioration.\nAfter lavage, the patient was transferred to the ICU and received mechanical ventilation. On postoperative day (POD) 1, the patient developed a high fever (38.8℃) and was diagnosed as having pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion in the right lower lobe, so antibiotics were administered. The chest tube was removed on POD 3, and extubation was performed on POD 4. The patient was transferred to the general ward on POD 7 and discharged on POD 19. Follow-up chest computed tomography was performed 40 days after the left-lung lavage; it showed interval decreases in the extent of PAP in both lungs, resolved parenchymal consolidation in the right lung, and decreased right pleural effusion ().\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?\n\nMaintenance Fluids Calculations: maintenance_fluid = base_value + weight_coefficient * weight, where base_value is 60 ml/hr for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 40 ml/hr for patients with a weight between 10kg and 20kg, and 0 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg, and weight_coefficient is 1 for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 2 for patients  with a weight between between 10kg and 20kg, and 4 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg",

Zolpidem was measured as 0.12 mg/L on urinalysis and 0.94 mg/L on serum biochemistry. Brain CT taken right after the visit revealed no evidences of acute brain hemorrhage and following MRI showed no evidences of acute infarction.\nAltered mentality of patient might have been due to zolpidem (0.94 mg/L) ingestion. The patient also had electrolyte imbalance. Hypernatremia and hyperchloremia were corrected by infusion of half-saline and hypermagnesemia was corrected by injection of 10% calcium gluconate 20 mL.

            "input": "A 60-year-old male with end-stage kidney disease due to ADPKD was admitted to our hospital for an evaluation of diplopia and left hemiplegia in March 2012. He had started maintenance hemodialysis in 2005. He had hypertension, which was relatively under good control with antihypertensive agents. He had no other arteriosclerotic risks such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, or smoking. He had no past medical history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or peripheral artery disease. The patient’s father and three brothers were also under hemodialysis due to ADPKD. None of the family members had a vascular system complication such as cerebral aneurysm, or past medical history of stroke. A brain CT scan image showed dilatation of left vertebral artery, basilar artery, bilateral post cerebral artery, and middle cerebral artery (Fig. a, b). At the time, he was diagnosed as vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia and started antihypertensive agents. In 2010, he was once admitted to our hospital for dysarthria, dysphagia and right hemiplegia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute infarction in the left midbrain, and he was started treatment with anticoagulant and additional antihypertensive agents. Although he recovered from dysarthria and dysphagia, right mild hemiplegia remained. However, he did not have any new stroke events until the admission in 2012.\nOn admission in 2012, his height was 163.1 cm, weight was 58.5 kg, consciousness level was 13 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, blood pressure was 146/92 mmHg, and body temperature was 36.7 °C. His conjunctiva was anemic, abdomen showed hepatomegaly and bilateral kidney swelling, and lower extremities had bilateral pitting edema. Neurological examination revealed prompt light reflection, isocoric pupil, limitation of the adduction of the right eye when gazing to the left, dysarthria, and bilateral incomplete paralysis.\nLaboratory data were as follows: serum Cr 10.7 mg/dL, BUN 48 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 4.4 mL/min/1.73 m2, hemoglobin (Hb) 10.7 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) 5700/μL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.4 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 6 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 6 IU/L and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 164 IU/L. Brain MRI showed acute ischemia of bilateral pons and right temporal lobe. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) did not show significant change in vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia compared with MRA in 2010. We started urokinase 60,000 unit/day and argatroban hydrate 60 mg/day. He was once recovered, and continued rehabilitation and maintenance hemodialysis. After 3 months of admission, he suddenly showed impaired consciousness of 6 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, convulsion, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. CT scan image did not show any cerebral hemorrhage. Exacerbation of cerebral infarction was suspected, and we started argatroban hydrate 60 mg/day, aleviatin, and non-invasive positive pressure (NPPV). Fourteen days after convulsion, he died of sudden fall in blood pressure (Fig. ).\nAn autopsy was performed, and the brain was pathologically examined. Macroscopically, massive hemorrhage in subarachnoid were seen due to rupture of basilar tip aneurysm (Fig. a, b). Autopsy diagnosis of his death was subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravascular lumen of the basilar tip aneurysm was nearly obstructed by thrombi (Fig. c). Old cerebral infarctions were seen in the left temporal lobe and other areas. Basilar, left vertebral, bilateral carotid, bilateral middle, and bilateral post cerebral artery showed irregular dilatation of the vessel wall. A microscopic examination of the dilatation area had rupture of the internal elastic lamina and thinning of the media (Fig. d). A wide range of vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia was also confirmed pathologically. In other organs, systemic arteries also showed marked atherosclerosis, and bilateral iliac artery had an aneurysm-like dilatation.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

She had been diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus, mild chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure and stayed at a nursing home. She was a wheelchair-user. At the initial presentation, the patient had a body temperature of 40.2 °C, blood pressure of 183/81 mmHg, and pulse of 74 beats per min. Hypoxemia was not confirmed. The physical examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray and urine test were normal. Laboratory tests revealed an elevation of blood urea nitrogen 23.8 mg/dl, creatinine 1.14 mg/dl and C-reactive protein 1.93 mg/dl. Platelet count was low at 105,000/μl. White cell count, hemoglobin and liver function tests were within normal range as shown in supplementary file. Two sets of blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi were drawn. Then, the patient was started empirically on meropenem and teicoplanin for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. In addition to blood cultures, a urinalysis with culture and a chest X-ray and CT were performed and found to be normal. The patient had no clinically evident sites of infection by history or physical examination. On day 2, a coryneform organism was recovered for 32 h by BACTEC (BD, Tokyo, Japan) from both the aerobic and anaerobic tubes of all blood cultures. Brevibacterium species were identified by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The score value was 2.36. On gram-stained smears from the culture plates, the organisms appeared as Gram-positive, club-shaped, slightly curved rods, and some coccal forms were present (Fig. a). The bacteria were subcultured on Trypticase Soy Agar II with 5% Sheep Blood (BD, Tokyo, Japan) at 35 °C in 5% CO2, which resulted in a gray-white, smooth, non-hemolytic colonies after a 48-incubation (Fig. b). Subsequently, genetic investigation by 16S ribosomal RNA analysis was performed in order to identify the organism. Finally, the result identified this pathogen as Brevibacterium paucivorans with 99.5% homology on the Ez taxon database ().\nFor comparison of a hydrolysis of casein in the organism, we obtained a type strain of B. casei, JCM 2594T and of B. paucivorans, JCM 11567T, from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms (JCM). Pyrazinamidase test was performed using PZA broth (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Casein hydrolysis test was performed as follows. 1) inoculate the organism on a skim milk agar, 2) incubate the plate at 37 °C, 3) examine the plate for zone of hydrolysis following incubation. Both the organism and JCM 11567T showed a lack of hydrolysis of casein, while a hydrolysis of casein was confirmed in JCM 2594T as shown in Fig. . The organism had an absence of pyrazinamidase, while JCM 2594T showed a presence of pyrazinamidase. Additional microbiological tests by API 50CH showed that utilization of D-arabinose and gluconate was negative. These results were consistent with the organism as B. paucivorans. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that the organism was susceptible to MEPM. Although the peripheral venous catheter site showed no erythema or tenderness, the catheter was removed without culture, and a follow-up blood culture remained negative after therapy lasting for 7 days. The patient’s fever finally abated and labs were also improved. On day 14, the antibiotic therapy was discontinued. On day 28 from admission, fever recurred and blood cultures were performed. Candida parapsilosis was isolated by 2 sets of blood cultures, and she was diagnosed as having candidemia. While L-AMB was started for Candida parapsilosis bacteremia, she died by candidemia on day 35.\nAntimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for the strain using the broth microdilution method (Dry Plate®, Eiken Chemical co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines []. The isolate was susceptible to gentamicin [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 1 μg/ml], ciplofloxacin (MIC = 0.25 μg/ml), vancomycin (MIC≦0.5 μg/ml), meropenem (MIC≦0.5 μg/ml) and rifampicin (MIC≦0.12 μg/ml), and was resistant to clindamycin (MIC> 4 μg/ml), and was intermediately resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC = 2 μg/ml),and cefepim (MIC = 2 μg/ml) as shown in Table .\n\nUsing the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nMDRD GFR Equation: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient, where race_coefficient is 1.212 for black patients and 1.0 for non-black parients, and gender_coefficient is 1 for men and 0.742 for women",

Found with extensor plantar response on right lower extremity was mild weakness of the right upper limb extensors and right lower limb flexors. Abnormal long signal of the left pontine was showed in brain MRI by FLAIR sequences (Fig. A). Conducting Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of neck and intracranial arteries revealed limited narrow on the right anterior cerebral artery A2 segment and the left anterior cerebral artery segment A3 and limited moderate stenosis on the initial segment of the right vertebral artery (Fig. B).

The patient stated that she had taken her buspirone only as directed, with the last dose on the morning of the fluoxetine overdose, about six hours earlier. She specifically denied ingesting any additional buspirone or any other medications. She admitted to “purging” herself daily for the last week. Other than some orthopedic surgical procedures, she denied any other significant past medical history, including seizures.\nThe paramedics arrived approximately 90 minutes post-ingestion and found the patient to be awake, alert, sitting up, and emotionally upset.

Vital signs were: temperature 36.9°C, pulse 82/min, blood pressure 112/78 mmHg, respirations 24/min. A repeat physical examination was unremarkable including the neurologic exam. Additional laboratory data obtained upon admission included serum creatinine kinase (140 IU/L), calcium (8.8 mg/dL), and a comprehensive urine drug screen (which combines the enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique, thin layer chromatography, and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy to detect over 1500 drugs and metabolites) that showed the presence of only phenobarbital, fluoxetine, ethanol, and caffeine. The laboratory verified that buspirone can be detected by this analysis. Quantitative serum levels of fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, and buspirone were ordered on admission. The fluoxetine level six hours after the ingestion was 922 ng/mL (therapeutic = 50–480 ng/mL) and the norfluoxetine level was 379 ng/mL (therapeutic = 50–450 ng/mL). The quantitative buspirone level could not be determined due to laboratory handling error. The patient was observed overnight without any further seizure activity or other unusual events. The psychiatry consultation and liaison service evaluated the patient the following morning and arranged for outpatient therapy. The patient was then discharged home in stable condition.\n\nWhat is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?\n\nAnion Gap: anion_gap = sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L))",

The patient received his second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine two days prior to admission. The next day he developed generalized body aches, nausea, and an episode of vomiting. He denied any fevers or chills. Though he normally ambulates independently, he was unable to stand or get out of bed due to weakness and generalized pain when he woke up the morning of admission. His admission medications included alogliptin, empagliflozin, insulin aspart, insulin glargine, losartan, metformin, pioglitazone, and tamsulosin. He reports no recent changes in medications or intake of over-the-counter medications. Past medical history was significant for COVID-19 infection three months prior, which required hospitalization for 13 days and treatment with convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone, according to institutional standard treatment protocols at the time.\nOn exam, vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 87/minute, temperature of 98.4° F, and respiratory rate of 16/minute. He was in no acute distress. His strength was normal and symmetric bilaterally, cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact, and sensory was intact to light touch bilaterally. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was negative for ischemia. Troponins, a respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel including influenza, and COVID-19 PCR were negative. Initial laboratory findings are summarized below (Table ). His serum creatinine kinase (CK) was 6,546 U/L. Complete metabolic panel revealed potassium 3.6 meq/L, sodium 130 meq/L, chloride 96 meq/L, glucose 219 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 23 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 112 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 47 U/L. His inflammatory markers were elevated with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 359 U/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 52 mm/Hr, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 146.8 mg/dL. Urinalysis excluded myoglobinuria and creatinine remained in his baseline range.\nRhabdomyolysis was diagnosed based on acute muscular pain and elevated CK. He is a diabetic elderly who had some nausea and vomiting but common causes of rhabdomyolysis were excluded as the patient denied trauma, recent surgery, strenuous exercise, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. He was not taking medications known to cause rhabdomyolysis including statins. No infections were identified. His serum glucose level was not elevated to a level that would point to a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.\nGiven the timeline of events, lack of alternate explanation, and known correlation of COVID-19 and rhabdomyolysis, the patient was felt to have vaccine-related rhabdomyolysis. The Naranjo score is a causality assessment tool validated to determine the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction []. For this patient, positive findings included the adverse event that appeared after the drug was given, the adverse event improved after the drug was discontinued, alternative causes were ruled out, and objective evidence of the adverse event was available (CK). The Naranjo Score was 6, which indicates the rhabdomyolysis was probably an adverse reaction to vaccination.\nHe received IV fluids overnight. His CK improved over the course of his hospital stay, and he did not develop significant acute kidney injury or electrolyte abnormalities. The patient regained his ability to ambulate independently, had improved myalgias, and was discharged in stable condition.\n\nWhat is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?\n\nSerum Osmolality: sOsm = 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18)",

At day four of life she underwent colostomy with resection of the affected colon from the mid transverse colon to the junction of the sigmoid and descending colon. She returned two months later for the second stage of the repair where she underwent a Soave endorectal pull thru procedure with incidental appendectomy. Since that time she has had a good recovery without constipation or diarrhea and with normal bowel function. She had recurrent tonsillitis and underwent tonsillectomy. She takes no medications. The patient complains of a sharp bilateral lower abdominal pain for the past two days that is greatest in the suprapubic region. She has had three episodes of emesis. She denies a change in bowel habits. She does report a low grade fever to 101. She denies dysuria, frequency or hematuria. She denies any history of sexual activity. Her first menstrual period was six weeks ago and her second menstrual period was two weeks ago. She complains of a new watery vaginal discharge for less than one day.\nUpon arrival her vitals are temperature 37.2 degrees Celsius by mouth, pulse 125 beats per minute, blood pressure 124/64 mm/Hg, and pulse ox 96% on room air. She weighs 45 kg. She is in obvious moderate distress due to her pain. Her bowel sounds are normal. Her abdomen is non distended and firm with voluntary guarding. It is diffusely tender, but worse in the bilateral lower quadrants without rebound tenderness. There is no CVA tenderness. On pelvic exam, there are normal external genitalia Tanner stage II-III with intact hymen from six o'clock to nine o'clock position. There are no obvious perineal or vaginal lacerations. A watery blood tinged discharge is present. The rest of her physical exam is unremarkable.\nInitial labs showed a normal metabolic panel. The complete blood count had a normal hemoglobin and hematocrit with a white blood cell count of 14.5 thou/cu mm. There were 64 percent neutrophils and 18 percent lymphocytes with 11 percent bands. Her urinalysis had 219 red blood cells and 85 white blood cells with a large amount of squamous epithelial cells. It was nitrite negative and had large leukocyte esterase. Urine PCR for gonorrhea and chlamydia was negative. The urine pregnancy test was negative. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast showed normal lung bases, liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, kidneys, and adrenal glands. There were no bowel obstruction noted. Bilateral dilated tubular structures were noted in the lower quadrants, adnexal regions, with wall enhancement and surrounding inflammatory changes consistent with bilateral pyosalpinx. There were no distinct drainable abscesses seen.\nSee Figures , , , and : CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast showing bilateral dilated fallopian tubes with pronounced wall enhancement\nShe received IV fluids and morphine for pain control, and she was admitted to gynecology service for IV antibiotics.

On admission, generalized edema was noted. Her external genitalia were normal female. Laboratory findings showed: hemoglobin, 9.8 g/dL; cholesterol, 120 mg/dL; total serum protein, 3.7 g/dL; serum albumin, 1.5 g/dL; BUN, 75 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 4.1 mg/dL; total calcium, 5.9 mg/dL; phosphorus, 12.7 mg/dL; sodium, 136 mEq/L; potassium, 5.5 mEq/L; chloride, 113 mEq/L; tCO2 7.8 mEq/L. Albuminuria and hematuria were detected. An ultrasonogram revealed enlarged kidneys with increased parenchymal echogenicity and poor corticomedullary differentiation. A renal biopsy was performed at the age of 29 days and light microscopy showed small glomeruli with various degrees of mesangial sclerosis (). The tubules were dilated with regenerative activity. Her karyotype was 46 XX. Analysis of the sequence of WT1 exon 9 revealed the presence of a heterozygous G to T base substitution, converting 396Asp to 396Tyr, and a heterozygous 395 Ser (TCC) > Ser (TCA) polymorphism (). Both parents showed normal sequence at these sites. Peritoneal dialysis was commenced with a temporary shift to hemodiafiltration because of dialysate leakage at the exit site. Sustained hypertension (120/80 mmHg) responded to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

The first episode was a sudden onset of complete paralysis below distal thigh, and he had no other symptoms except leg paralysis. At a local clinic, physical examination revealed symmetric hyporeflexia in both lower extremities. Laboratory analysis revealed mild hypokalemia as below: Na+, 146 mmol/L; K+, 2.7 mmol/L; Cl-, 110 mmol/L; tCO2, 25 mmol/L without abnormality of blood gas analysis. Electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia without atrioventricular block or prominent U wave. However, further evaluation for hypokalemia was not taken, even though there was a suggestion of hypokalemic paralysis, and the patient was just advised to eat an adequate dietary supplement of potassium rich food without any medication by the local clinic. After two weeks, a second episode of leg weakness occurred after morning meal. The muscle weakness was initially subtle but progressed in paralysis below knee and lasted for 6 hours. Thus, he was referred to our hospital. However, the patient visited our clinic the next day, when the paralysis had already subsided.\nThere was no past history or family history of neuromuscular disease and endocrinologic disease, except for his aunt's hypothyroidism. His appearance was reasonably healthy. His height was 168 cm, his weight was 60 kg, and his body mass index was 21.2 kg/m2. His blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg, his respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and his body temperature was 36.8℃. He had mild tachycardia with a heart rate of 100-110 beats/min,, but he had no palpitations. Neurological examination findings, including deep tendon reflex and cerebellar function test, were normal. The laboratory findings showed normal complete blood cell counts, normal electrolytes as below: Na+, 140 mmol/L; K+, 4.4 mmol/L; Cl-, 104 mmol/L; tCO2, 24 mmol/L. The laboratory findings also showed his normal liver, kidney and cardiac functions. His urine K+ excretion rate was normally low as 0.96 of urine K+/Cr ratio (range, 0-2). There were no abnormal laboratory findings to suggest adrenal hormone excess or primary hyperaldosteronism: adrenocorticotropic hormone, 40.11 pg/mL (range, 3.5-13.2 pg/mL); cortisol, 8.7 µg/dL (range, 5.0-23.0 µg/dL); 17 hydroxyprogesterone, 2.68 ng/mL (range, 0.6-3.42 ng/mL); aldosterone, 180.29 pg/mL (range, 38.9-306.8 pg/mL); renin, 6.13 ng/mL/hr (range, 1.31-3.95 ng/mL/hr); epinephrine, 0.030 ng/mL (range, 0-0.30 ng/mL); norepinephrine, 0.087 ng/mL (range, 0-0.80 ng/mL). Thyroid function test (TFT) revealed a hyperthyroidism: serum free thyroxine (fT4), 2.10 ng/dL (range, 0.70-1.48 ng/dL); triiodothyronine (T3), 2.95 ng/mL (range, 0.58-1.59 ng/mL); thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), <0.025 mU/L (range, 0.35-4.94 mU/L). Thus, he was diagnosed as having hypokalemic paralysis due to hyperthyroidim. Serum TSH receptor antibodies were high at 6.05 IU/L (range, 0-1.75 IU/L), thyroid stimulating antibody was positive, and thyroid ultrasonography revealed diffuse enlarged thyroid and increased vascularity. These findings were consistent with Graves' disease as etiology of his hyperthyroidism. He was initially treated with lower dose of an antithyroid drug (methimazole 5 mg once daily) than usual, since his thyrotoxic symptoms and signs were absent, and his level of serum fT4 was not prominent. In addition, a β-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) was simultaneously used for preventing the paralysis. After two weeks, a follow-up TFT revealed aggravated hyperthyroidism, and he was treated with increased dose of antithyroid drugs. After two months, since his heart rate and blood pressure were stable and he had no symptoms of palpitations, β-blockers were discontinued successfully. No paralysis has occurred for one year, as hyperthyroidism can be well controlled with antithyroid drugs ().\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

Although he reported a normal appetite, he was known to vomit frequently, particularly after a large meal. He had been diagnosed with hypokalemia and had been treated with potassium supplements at a previous hospital. However, because of persistent nausea and vomiting, he was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of hypokalemia. His medical and family histories were unremarkable, and he did not report the use of medications such as diuretics and/or herbal medication. Physical examination upon admission showed he was 175 cm tall and weighed 44.5 kg, which indicated a weight loss from his previous weight of 58 kg over the previous 2 years.

Urinary levels of sodium/potassium/chloride (Na/K/Cl) were 95/73.2/47mEq/L, respectively, his urinary creatinine measured 111.12mg/dL, and the trans-tubular potassium gradient was 17. Urinalysis showed the following findings: blood -, albumin ±, glucose -, and ketones -. Upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography showed no abnormalities. The SLC12A3 gene mutation test for Gitelman syndrome was observed to be negative. He was diagnosed with chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis with kidney failure and treated with saline hydration, potassium supplementation, and spironolactone. Serum potassium increased to 3.0mEq/L; however, his nausea and vomiting persisted.\nA renal biopsy was performed for the evaluation of renal dysfunction. Microscopically, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration was identified. Renal tubular epithelial cells showed mild nuclear variation with conspicuous nucleoli and cytoplasmic vacuolization, indicating regenerative changes after acute tubular necrosis. Several foci of dystrophic calcification were identified among the tubular epithelial cells. A few shrunken glomeruli were observed suggesting ischemic damage; however, most glomeruli revealed no definitive abnormalities such as mesangial cell proliferation, segmental sclerosis, and/or deposition of immune complexes ().

Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest confirmed a left pneumothorax, that the right chest was filled with fluid (there was a question of aspiration), and the presence of bilateral pulmonary edema; CT of head demonstrated a left occipital fracture, multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages, and a left subdural hematoma that was determined not to need surgical evacuation because of its size and minimal midline shift (see CT scan figures , , ); and the CT scan of the abdomen was negative.\nHe was transferred to the intensive care unit where a right internal jugular 9 French sheath was placed for introduction of a pulmonary artery catheter, as was an intracranial pressure monitor (Camino). His initial ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure were 37 mm Hg and 57 mm Hg, respectively, on ventilator settings of assist control (AC) 30 (respiratory rate was 34), positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 (zero) mm Hg, tidal volume (Vt) 650 ml, FiO2 1.0, with an ABG of pH 7.28, PaCO2 44 mm Hg, PaO2 63 mm Hg, and HCO3 20 meq/L. The SpO2 was 92%, the central venous pressure was 12 mm Hg, and the lactate was 8.5 mmol/L (which improved with further resuscitation).\nOver the next seven days the patient's pulmonary status deteriorated and severe ARDS became manifest in the face of continued high ICP despite intensive intervention. On the morning of the seventh hospital day a critical point was reached. The ICP spiked to 70 mm Hg and remained over 50 mm Hg for greater than 2 minutes notwithstanding the use of mannitol, furosemide, hyperventilation, sedation, and paralysis, although these efforts maintained the CPP from 47–77 mm Hg. This high ICP occurred in the face of hypoxia and acidemia; ABG of pH 7.33, PaCO2 50 mm Hg, PaO2 54 mm Hg, base excess 0.1 mmol/L, and HCO3 26 meq/L while ventilated on AC 50 with Vt 500 ml, PEEP 7 cm H2O, and FiO2 1.0. The cardiac output was 11 liters/minute, and the cardiac index was 4.9 liters/minute/m2. The PEEP was raised to 17 cm H2O incrementally, while at the same time carefully evaluating ICP, peak inspiratory and plateau pressures, and oxygenation, in an effort to increase the PaO2 to an acceptable level (a goal of PaO2 100 mm Hg). In view of the fact that maximized ventilator settings, adequate sedation, paralysis, and inhalational therapies (albuterol and ipratropium) had neither improved the patient's intracranial pressures, nor his oxygenation, use of INO was implemented specifically to improve oxygenation and thereby decrease ICP. INO was instituted at 20 ppm. In a period of 35 minutes the ICP decreased to 15 mm Hg and PaO2 improved; ABG pH 7.35, PaCO2 49 mm Hg, PaO2 86 mm Hg, BE 0.7, and HCO3 27 meq/L on the same ventilator settings. Over 6 hours the PEEP was weaned to 11 cm H2O and the PaO2 remained at 90 mm Hg with the ICP ranging from 15–29 mm Hg. After 24 hours of INO at 20 ppm the ICP ranged from 12–20 mm Hg and the ABG was pH 7.47, PCO2 43 mm Hg, PaO2 165 mm Hg, BE 7.1 and HCO3 31 meq/L on AC 45, Vt 550, FiO2 95% and PEEP of 8 mm Hg. The INO was weaned over several days (there was no evidence of methemoglobinemia). The patient was discontinued from mechanical ventilation on hospital day 30. CT scan demonstrated no mass effect, but atrophy and hypodensity of the left temporal lobe. He was discharged to a rehabilitative traumatic brain injury unit on hospital day 34. Although he could follow commands, he had post-traumatic amnesia, a right hemiparesis, and moderate-severe cognitive, linguistic and language defects.\n\nWhat is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?\n\nAnion Gap: anion_gap = sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L))",

During the course of the delivery, intravenous short-term infusion of 0.2 mg methylergometrine and 30IE oxytocin was administered for easy release of the placenta and prevention of bleeding during the post-partum phase. There were no complications during delivery. Approximately 30 minutes after delivery, the patient developed severe distress and chest pain. On physical examination, rales were detected in both lungs (Killip class II). The patient was transferred to our hospital for further investigation.\nOn electrocardiogram, a sinus tachycardia (100/min) without ST-segment changes was seen. The patient's blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and her pO2 was 52 mmHg without oxygen supplementation. Chest x-ray revealed severe fluid consolidation (N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide-brain natriuretic peptide value 3900 pg/ml). Oxygen and loop diuretics rapidly improved the patient's respiratory status. The initial two-dimensional echocardiography showed moderately reduced systolic left ventricular function with a midventricular hypokinesia. Left ventricular end diastolic diameter was normal. The ejection fraction as measured by the Simpson's method was 38%. Laboratory investigations found raised levels of troponin T (0.19 ng/ml,; normal < 0.03 ng/mL) and creatine kinase (356 U/L; normal < 145 U/L). The patient was started on diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, after which she recovered quickly and showed no respiratory distress or other signs of heart failure.\nIn the absence of any cardiovascular risk factors and the age of the patient, we decided against using coronary angiography for initial anatomic. We conducted contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, which showed a circular midventricular hypokinesia and no delayed enhancement after gadolinium application. Neither myocardial necrosis nor ischemia were seen, therefore coronary angiography was not performed\nThe patient's cardiac enzymes normalized within three days after admission. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed that systolic left ventricular function had completely recovered without any wall motion abnormalities within those three days.\nBased on the patient's history with absence of cardiovascular risk factors, mild cardiac enzyme elevation and CMR findings of midventricular hypokinesia without necrosis and ischemia, she was diagnosed with tako-tsubo CMP.

She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.\nPatient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Delta Ratio: albumin_corrected_delta_ratio = albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

Her chief complaint was one year of abdominal discomfort associated with an epigastric mass and weight loss of 30 kg. Simple and contrasted abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with focal lesions, the largest being 15 cm in segment VIII, and satellite lesions of up to 5.5 cm in segment VII and 3.5 cm in segment III, with similar morphologic characteristics. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a liver with no signs of chronic disease, and an infiltrative dominant lesion of 11 x 8 cm in segments IV and V, associated with smaller lesions in both lobules of 1.6 cm in segment III, and 0.9 cm in segments VII and VIII (Figure ). Subsequently, the patient presented aggressiveness and disorientation, where hypoglycemia was documented (33 mg/dL) and treated with dextrose 10% with complete symptom resolution.\nPhysical examination revealed cachectic facies, and an abdominal mass of approximately 13 cm located in epigastrium and right hypochondrium, associated with hepatomegaly.

Given our patient’s profile, a “big” IGF-II measurement was attempted, but the assay is not available in Colombia. Therefore, hypoglycemia due to tumor consumption vs paraneoplastic hypoglycemia due to “big”-IGF II production were the suspected diagnoses. The patient required treatment with 50% dextrose in continuous infusion to achieve normal blood glucose and to remain symptom free.\nA positron emission tomography (PET/CT) with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) was performed (Figure ), where multiple hypermetabolic hepatic masses were observed, in both hepatic lobules; the high uptake index suggested an elevated glucose consumption tumor. Liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of trabecular and fibrolamellar hepatocarcinoma (Figure ). Given the size and presence of metastatic disease, the patient was not a candidate for surgical treatment; transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was done twice with partial improvement, but the dextrose infusion could not be stopped. A glucagon therapeutic test was performed, with inadequate response. Thereafter, an OctreoScan was performed (Figure ) to determine if the patient could benefit from somatostatin analogs, but uptake was observed in a pulmonary metastasis only, reducing success probability with such therapy. Finally, despite different interventions, hypoglycemia control could not be achieved and, consequently, parenteral nutrition with a high dextrose load was started to continue ambulatory palliative care.\n\nWhat is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?\n\nSodium Correction for Hyperglycemia: correction = Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100)",

Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.\nSerology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.\nBecause of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.\nOver the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ). The patient left hospital and made a complete recovery with no residual effects (Table ).\n\nWhat is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?\n\nSodium Correction for Hyperglycemia: correction = Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100)",

His vital signs were: blood pressure 120/80 mmHg; pulse rate 90 beats/min.; respiration rate 19/min.; body temperature 38.5°C. His past medical history consisted of surgery for a thrombophlebitis in his right arm one year earlier.\nUpon physical examination, a distended and diffusely tender abdomen with right lower abdomen rebound was revealed. The patient's skin and mucosa were pale.\nThe emergent laboratory tests revealed as follow: white blood cells (WBC): 12.6 × 109/liter; serum creatinine: 126 mol/L; blood urea nitrogen: 8.6 mmol/L; blood sugar: 11.6 mmol/L; Na: 141 mmol/L; K: 4.0 mmol/L; Ca++: 1.08 mmol/L; urinalysis: a lot of mucus, 4–6 Leucocytes; some epithelial cells.

Intra operative findings revealed diffuse fibro purulent peritonitis with adhesions between small bowels; and about 40 cm from Bauchini valve the presence of a sharp chicken wishbone perforated the ileum at the ante mesenteric site (Figure ). The wall of that part of the ileum was thick and succulent. The patient was treated after the adhesiolisis with resection of the perforated distal ileum and ileum stoma. The postoperative treatment went well; the wound healed per secundum. Clebsiela spp. was isolated in the stained abdominal liquid and treated with the proper antibiotics. Four months after the first operation and losing 25 kg, the patient underwent reconstruction of bowel continuity, and discharged on the tenth postoperative day with normal bowel movements.\nRetrospectively, after the first operation the patient admitted that four days earlier he had rapidly eaten and swallowed several mouthfuls of chicken meat without chewing and accidentally ingested a chicken bone.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

Past history was significant for repeated episodes of muscle weakness. At that time, she was diagnosed to have hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) and started on oral potassium supplementation. Her physical examination was normal except for subtrochanteric fractures of bilateral femora. There was no muscle weakness of both upper limbs. The power in the lower limbs could not be tested due to fractures of both femora. On investigation, serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dl, BUN 26 mg/dl, S. Na+ - 133 mmol/L, S.K+ 2.7 mmol/L, S. Ca++ 9.7 mg/dl, S.phosphorus 2.1 mg/dl, uric acid 2 mg/dl, S.bilirubin 0.5 mg/dl, SGOT 42 U/L, SGPT 23 U/L, S.albumin 3.2 mg/dl, and alkaline phosphatase 837 mg/dl. Her Vitamin D3 was 10 ng/ml and S.PTH 38.5 pg/ml. Her thyroid function tests were normal. Analysis of arterial blood gases (ABGs) (on room air) revealed pH of 7.22, PaO2 of 61, PCO2 of 23, HCO3 of 11.3 with base deficit of - 17 mmol/L, Na+ - 139 meq/L, K+ 2.3 mmol/L, Ca++ 0.41 mmol/L, Cl − - 122 mmol/L, and an anion gap of 8 meq/L. The urinary pH was 7.5. On radiological evaluation, there was an acute pathological subtrochanteric fracture of left femur, old subtrochanteric fracture of the right femur and left proximal fibula. On ultrasound abdomen, there was dystrophic parenchymal calcification in the left kidney and mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the right side. Tc-99m diethylene triamine penta acetic acid revealed nonfunctioning left kidney with the normally functioning right kidney. Electrocardiography (ECG) was normal except for frequent ventricular ectopics. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. A bone scan showed avid uptake of tracer in right sixth rib, left seventh rib, bilateral proximal femora, left proximal fibula, shaft of the right humerus, and renal cortex [].\nBased on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed to have RTA (distal or type 1, normal anion gap hyperchloremic acidosis) with hypokalemia, nephrocalcinosis, and metabolic bone disease. Surgery was deferred in order to optimize the condition of the patient. The goal of therapy was to maintain serum pH of >7.3 and S.K+ >3 mmol/L. She was started on potassium supplementation intravenously (IV), followed by oral potassium 21 meq tid, tablet alfacalcidol 0.25 mcg, oral sodium bicarbonate 1 g (11.9 mmol) thrice a day, and oral calcium 500 mg BD. After 4 days, ABG analysis showed pH 7.307, PaO296 mmHg, PCO225 mm Hg, HCO312.3 mmol/L with base deficit of - 12.6 mmol/L, K+ 3.1 mmol/L, and Ca++ 0.92 mmol/L. She was posted for interlocking nailing of fracture of left femur to be followed by right femur after 2 days.\nOn the day of surgery, she was premedicated with tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg and tablet pantoprazole 40 mg 2 h prior to shifting to the operation theatre (OT). In the OT, standard monitors were attached and wide bore IV access was secured. Radial arterial cannulation was done for continuous blood pressure monitoring and ABG analysis. Under strict aseptic precautions, epidural space was located in sitting position at L3-4 intervertebral space through a median approach by the loss of resistance to air with an 18G Tuohy needle. A subarachnoid block was established with the administration of 3 ml of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine with 25 μg of fentanyl via 27G spinal needle (needle through needle technique). A 22G epidural catheter was passed into the epidural space and fixed at 9 cm. The time taken for onset of the subarachnoid block was approximately 5-6 min and the highest level of the block (T8) was achieved within 13 min. During the procedure, which lasted for 120 min, 1.5 L of ringer lactate was infused and normal saline was avoided. IV sodium bicarbonate and potassium supplementation were given based on ABG findings so as to maintain pH of more than 7.3 and >3 -5 mEq/L. A total of 50 meq of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate and 10 meq of potassium chloride were infused. Intraoperative vitals were stable, blood loss was approximately 300 ml, and urine output was 20-40 ml/h. For postoperative analgesia, a bolus of 8 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine (after a test dose of 3 ml of 2% lignocaine without epinephrine) was given epidurally and an infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine was started at 6 ml/h. The operation on the contralateral femur was done under epidural anesthesia 2 days later. Postoperatively, ECG was continuously monitored and ABG analysis was done twice a day for 3 days. Oral bicarbonate and potassium supplements were continued and additional IV supplementation was given as required.

Dietary history was suggestive of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and adequate sun exposure. No history of malabsorption or renal disorder. On examination, height 150 cm (5–10 percentile), weight 32 <5th percentile, US: LS = 0.96, percentile target height: 161.5 cm, genu valgum deformity noted, intermalleolar distance: 10.9 cm, bilateral wrist widening noted.\nBiochemical evaluation revealed serum calcium: 14.2 mg/dl, phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dl, 25(OH) vitamin D: 25.10 nmol/L, iPTH: 1967 pg/ml, alkaline phosphatase: 1400 U/L, 24 hours urinary calcium: 282 mg/24 hours. Imaging: X-ray hand showed features of rickets [Figures -]. CT neck: Features s/o left superior parathyroid adenoma. Lesion in lower pole of left lobe of thyroid Sestamibi scan: S/o functioning parathyroid adenoma on left side. She underwent left inferior parathyroidectomy in May 2010: however, on follow up after 1 year she was found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium and was then referred to SGPGI with a diagnosis of persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT).\nAt evaluation in SGPGI there were no records of previous surgery; repeat methoxy iso butyl isonitrile (MIBI) revealed a superior parathyroid adenoma on left side and was concordant with the ultrasonography (USG) finding of a left superior parathyroid adenoma. Bilateral neck exploration was performed with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. At operation, both right parathyroid glands were found to be grossly normal; a left superior parathyroid adenoma was found which was excised (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm, weight 2.2 gm). However, left inferior parathyroid gland could not be found. IOPTH according to Miami criteria was curative, as there was >50% drop from the pre-excision value of 2130 to 231 at 10 minutes. Histophalogical examination was suggestive of parathyroid adenoma. At the last follow up, in 2016, her biochemical parameters including calcium and iPTH were within normal limits and she was free of bone pains, though her genu valgum persisted.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

            "input": "A 62-year-old female was admitted for dyspnea. Her only medical history was cutaneous lupus treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate for 8 years. Physical examination found dyspnea, edema limited to the lower extremities and superior vena cava syndrome. Laboratory tests confirmed hypoxemia with PaO2 at 70 mmHg; and normal renal function (creatinine: 0.97 mg/dL). A computed tomography (CT) scan found normal pulmonary parenchyma and vascularization, but revealed the presence of an anterior mediastinal mass. A PET scan confirmed positive metabolic activity of the mediastinal mass (Fig. A). A biopsy was performed under mediastinoscopy. Pathological examination of the mass revealed the presence of pseudo-epithelial tumor cells of the thymus, while the thymic cortex was normal, without lymphocyte infiltration in the tumor tissue. These features led to a diagnosis of type A non-invasive thymoma (Fig. B).\nWhile investigations on the mediastinal mass were being performed, the patient developed acute kidney injury (Creatinine 4.7 mg/dL), with nephrotic syndrome: serum albumin was 9.7 g/L, proteinuria was 17 g/g (composed of more than 80% of albumin) and microscopic hematuria was positive. In agreement with the nephrotic syndrome, a high level of cholesterol (total cholesterol = 3.07 g/l triglycerides = 1.19 g/l, LDL = 2.13 g/l), and lower levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG 2.58 g/l, IgA 1.73 g/l, IgM 2.5 g/l) were also found. Results of the renal biopsy were as follows: normal kidney parenchyma on optical microscopy and immuno-fluorescence analysis without any proliferation or deposition. Electronic microscopy showed extensive foot process effacement corresponding to a loss of cell differentiation, loss of pedicels and increased collagen matrix production, creating a gap between the podocyte and glomerular basement membrane (Fig. D). No podocyte detachment was observed and there was no evidence in favour of a diagnosis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Regarding immunologic tests, anti-nucleic antibodies were positive (1/160), but Extractable Nuclear Antigen (ENA) antibodies, complement fractions C3/C4, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Similarly, tests for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and cryoprotein were all negative. Our final diagnosis was minimal change disease (MCD) associated with thymoma. Therefore, oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) was initiated immediately and thymectomy was performed.\nEight weeks after initiation of the steroid therapy, the patient showed a significant lack of response to steroid therapy, with serum albumin of 10 g/L, and proteinuria of 13.5 g/g, Clinical examination found exacerbation of asthenia as well as edema. Given the intensity and the persistence of nephrotic syndrome, with no improvement after steroid induction, we decided to reinforce the treatment with rituximab (1 g given twice, 15 days apart). We monitored the CD19 count (96/mm3 before administration and 0/mm3 after the second dose - this is in agreement with the profound lymphocyte depletion expected). Over the following days, we noticed a progressive improvement in both albuminemia and proteinuria. Complete remission was observed 3 weeks after infusion of rituximab. We followed French guidelines for tapering off the corticosteroids. After 11 weeks at high dose (1 mg/kg/day = 80 mg/d from 09/06/19 to 22/08/19), we pursued with 50 mg/d for 2 weeks, 35 mg/d for 2 weeks, 25 mg/d for 2 weeks, 20 mg/d for 2 weeks, 17.5 mg/d for 2 weeks, 15 mg/d for 2 weeks, 10 mg/d for 2 weeks, 7.5 mg/d for 4 weeks, 5 mg/d for 4 weeks, followed by steroid withdrawal using hydrocortisone. At the last follow-up, serum albumin was 38 g/L, proteinuria was 0.6 g/g and creatinine 0.83 mg/dL (Fig. A). The patient consented to collection of serum at different timepoints. We performed a cytokine profile using a bead assay (Legendplex human inflammation panel, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) on serum collected before (BM1, BM2 and BM3) and after treatment with rituximab (BM4). We did not find any deregulation of the cytokine profile before treatment with rituximab, either on the TH1 side (INFg, TNF, IL6, IL12) or the TH2 side (IL4, IL5, IL10, IL13). Cytokines were in the normal range, except for MCP1 and IL18, which were increased. Interestingly, no modification was found on the serum collected after treatment with rituximab, suggesting that the beneficial effect of this treatment was not mediated by a modification of the cytokine balance (Fig. B and C).\n\nUsing the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nMDRD GFR Equation: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient, where race_coefficient is 1.212 for black patients and 1.0 for non-black parients, and gender_coefficient is 1 for men and 0.742 for women",

He was found to have kidney failure 2 months previously and was initiated on hemodialysis due to uremic encephalopathy. He was admitted to our institution for further work-up investigations for his kidney failure. His laboratory investigations were as follows:hemoglobin: 9 g/dL, white cell counts: 4,700 u/L, platelet count: 171,000/mm3. Urine DR showed yellow color with clear appearance, pH of 5, specific gravity of 1.010, 4 red blood cells per high-power field, 1 WBCs per high-power field, urine protein of 1.0 g/L, and 2 RBCs cast andurine protein to creatinine ratio: 3.9, BUN: 109 mg/dL, creatinine: 4.8 mg/dL, electrolytes: serum sodium 141 mmol/L, potassium 5.0 mmol/L, chloride 116 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 14.5 mmol/L, ANA: negative, C-ANCA: negative, P-ANCA: negative, hepatitis B surface antigen: nonreactive, hepatitis C antibody: nonreactive, PT/APTT/INR: 10.5/30.2/1. Because of symptomatic uremia, a right internal jugular nontunneled catheter was inserted on 28 of July 2012 for hemodialysis. In view of his normal size kidneys, a biopsy was done on 1 August 2012 to look for reversible causes. The biopsy showed 20 glomeruli in which 14 were globally sclerosed or severely collapsed and condensed. Several of them were associated with fibrocellular crescents with disruption of bowman's capsule and 4 had cellular crescents. Immunofluorescence showed IgA positivity in the mesangium and along the capillary walls. He was pulsed with methyl prednisolone 500 mg once a day for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 25 mg twice a day. Cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil was not added in view of 14/20 sclerosed glomeruli and fibrocellular crescents. As there was no sign of renal recovery, the patient was discharged on three times a week dialysis through right internal jugular catheter with followup in nephrology outpatients clinic.\nHe was readmitted on 8 August 2012 approximately one week after discharge, with a two-day history of high grade fever, mild productive cough, frothy sputum, and hemoptysis. On physical examination, he was febrile with a temperature of 39°C, a heart rate of 100 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 139/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% at room air. He was pale and nonedematous. He had bilateral basal crepitations on chest examination. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. His laboratory workup showed BUN 74 mg/dL, serum creatinine, 4.8 mg/dL, serum sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 4.7 mmol/L, chloride 109 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 19.1 mmol/L. His CBC showed hemoglobin of 7.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 25%, MCV 82 fl, WBC 3000 u/L, and platelet count of 70000/mm3. There was no evidence of hemolysis as his reticulocyte count was 2% and LDH was 250 IU/L. His iron study showed trasferrin saturation of 12%. Chest X-ray showed bilateral hilar congestion and minimal bilateral pleural effusion. Blood cultures were sent both from peripheral vein and dialysis catheter. In view of one episode of hemoptysis, bronchoscopy was done which was normal. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed no growth of acid fast bacilli and fungal smear was negative. Blood cultures from peripheral veins showed AH which was sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, ceftriaxone, cefixime, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin. Blood culture from dialysis catheter also grew the same organism with the same sensitivities. Dialysis solution culture did not grow anything. His dialysis catheter was removed after hemodialysis and 1 pint of pack cells was transfused. The patient was also started on erythropoietin 4000 unit subcutaneously three times a week. Intravenous iron was not given in view of sepsis. He was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam 2.25 gm 8 hourly for a total of 14 days. He responded to antibiotics and became afebrile after 48 hours. A second right internal jugular nontunneled catheter was inserted after 48 hours of antibiotics. He was discharged on 16 August 2012 with a new right internal jugular temporary catheter with the advice of three times a week hemodialysis. A plan for arteriovenous fistula after two weeks of antibiotics was also made. His repeat blood cultures on day 5 were negative. His anemia responded to erythropoietin and pack red cell transfusion. After completion of course of antibiotics, he was put on intravenous iron sucrose 100 milligram each dialysis for a total of 10 doses. Subsequent laboratory results on day 5 showed hemoglobin of 10 gm, hematocrit of 30%, MCV 82 fl, WBC 5000 u/L, and platelet count of 170000/mm3.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta ratio?\n\nDelta Ratio: delta_ratio = delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

She was on candesartan (8 mg once daily), amlodipine (2.5 mg once daily), and apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily). Her body weight was 39 kg, and height was 159 cm. All laboratory findings were within normal range. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm and no evidence of ischaemic changes or ST elevation. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. She showed a dilated left atrium (LA diameter: 31 mm, LA volume index: 35 mL/m2) and normal left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction: 76%). Pre-procedural cardiac computed tomography (CT) showed four pulmonary veins, and slight dilated ascending aorta (maximum diameter: 40 mm, ) with mild calcific plaques. We decided to perform CA for AF, and recommended TOE before the CA to assess the presence or absence of left atrial appendage thrombus (LAAT) because she had a CHADS2 score of 4.\nOn the day before the CA, TOE was performed with an iE33 (Philips Medical System, Andover, MA, USA) with a 4-MHz OmniPlane probe. After local pharyngeal anaesthesia with lidocaine spray, the patient was placed in the left lateral position and midazolam (3 mg) was administered for mild sedation. Her physical examination showed a regular pulse rate (PR) of 62 b.p.m., a blood pressure (BP) of 117/84 mmHg, and a normal temperature. Her physical examinations at the time of TOE procedure were unremarkable. At 3 min after probe insertion, she had a BP of 117/84 mmHg, PR of 62 b.p.m., and there was no abnormal finding of the ascending aorta at that time (). We then administered additional midazolam (2 mg) due to body movement. At 5 min after the insertion, we confirmed that the absence of LAAT (BP: 95/40 mmHg, PR: 76 b.p.m.). However, TOE showed ascending aortic dissection without pericardial effusion (). The probe was removed at the end of anaesthesia after flumazenil (0.2 mg) infusion. After waking, she had severe back pain, and underwent a contrast-enhanced cardiac CT. Cardiac CT demonstrated Stanford type A aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the bifurcation of common iliac arteries, and tight stenosis in the right coronary artery (maximum diameter; 49 mm, ). An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and no ST-segment abnormalities. The patient underwent a replacement of the ascending aorta, and a coronary artery bypass graft surgery for the right coronary artery.

            "input": "A 20-year-old woman presented with progressively worsening dyspnea for 6 months. She had no history of evaluation or treatment for her symptoms, although the symptoms started at the age of high school. Her symptoms became worse with time, and she presented with NYHA class III exertional dyspnea and orthopnea. Her height, weight, and body surface area were 156 cm, 49 kg, and 1.45 m2 respectively. Her vital signs were blood pressure 104/68 mmHg, heart rate 104/min, and respiratory rate 22/min. A regular heart beat was detected with wide fixed splitting of S2 at the pulmonary valve area, and no clubbing of the fingers or nails was observed. A simple chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and a dilated pulmonary trunk with cephalization of pulmonary vascular marking. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with compatible findings of RV hypertrophy. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large tissue defect of 29 mm with a bi-directional shunt through the interatrial septum (). The RV was prominently dilated and revealed significantly decreased contractility with a D-shaped left ventricle (LV) showing normal contractility (). There was no significant RV hypertrophy. The systolic pulmonary arterial pressure measured by maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TR Vmax) was estimated at 95 mmHg (TR Vmax = 4.6 m/sec), which was roughly equal to systemic systolic blood pressure (). Her walking distance was 362 m on the 6-minute walking test with slightly decreased oxygen saturation from 98% to 92%. Further evaluations to identify the etiology of the pulmonary hypertension included a pulmonary function test, chest computed tomography angiogram and autoimmune panel, but all were negative.\nCardiac catheterization confirmed severe pulmonary hypertension with a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 48 mmHg (76/36 mmHg absolute) and pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp) of 9.6 Wood units (WU) on room air. The mean systemic arterial pressure was 84 mmHg (97/73 mmHg absolute). After administering oxygen (10 L/min for 10 minutes via a nasal prong) and inhaling iloprost, her mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 50 and 46 mmHg respectively, and had not changed significantly. We failed to identify the pulmonary arterial responsibility after pulmonary vasodilator administration. Based on these findings, closure of the ASD was not performed. Instead, medical treatment including oral bosentan was started to improve patient's symptom.\nHer symptoms and exercise tolerance improved from NYHA class III to NYHA class I to II after 1 year of using bosentan. She was able to walk 426 m during the 6-min walk test without desaturation. A follow-up echocardiogram showed no significant interval change except slight improvement in RV contractility compared to the initial echocardiogram, even though her symptoms were much improved. TR Vmax was 4.3 m/sec by continuous wave Doppler test, but there was no significant improvement in comparison with the initial test. Although the follow-up echocardiogram result was very disappointing, we decided to perform a cardiac catheterization and balloon occlusion test to confirm the change in Rp and possibly correct the ASD. We expected some favorable changes in pulmonary vascular physiology, because her exercise tolerance had much improved.\nA follow-up cardiac catheterization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension with mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 45 mmHg (75/29 mmHg absolute). The mean aortic pressure was 74 mmHg (95/60 mmHg absolute). Although the patient still had severe pulmonary hypertension, Rp had decreased markedly from 9.6 to 4.2 WU and calculated pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) increased from 1.9 to 2.6 in comparison with the initial data. We performed the transient balloon occlusion test using a 34 mm sizing balloon for 10 minutes. As a result, mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased to 36 mmHg (48/25 mmHg absolute), and mean aortic pressure increased to 85 mmHg (118/70 mmHg absolute). We decided to close the ASD with a transcatheter occluder device considering her young age and the high perioperative risk. We performed percutaneous closure of the defect with a 34 mm Amplatzer® septal occluder (AGA Medical Corp., Minneapolis, MN, USA).\nNo residual leak was observed on the follow-up transthoracic echocardiography. The patient was given antiplatelet therapy and was maintained on 62.5 mg bosentan bid with diuretics and an angiotensin receptor blocker for 1 year. Finally, her physical activity and symptoms were much improved as she could walk 554 m on the walk test 1 year after the device was deployed. A chest X-ray showed remarkably decreased pulmonary vascularity, but cardiomegaly remained. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography showed increased left atrial size from 37 to 42 mm and LV chamber size of end-diastole/end-systole from 40/23 to 46/28 mm. RV size had decreased significantly, and RV contractility was much improved in comparison with the initial study, but a compressed LV still remained on the parasternal short axis view (). TR Vmax also decreased markedly from 4.6 m/sec to 3.0 m/sec ().\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?\n\nAdjusted Body Weight: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg))",

Her general practitioner had initiated treatment with metformin (1,000 mg twice-daily) and simvastatin (40 mg once-daily), but compliance was limited. At her first visit to our outpatient clinic her body weight was 90 kg and her body mass index 32.6 kg/m2. She was asymptomatic and clinical examination, fundus photography, filament testing and albumin/creatinine ratio revealed no signs of complications related to type 2 diabetes. Blood samples showed a glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8.9% (74 mmol/mol) and a fasting plasma glucose of 7.3 mmol/l. LFTs showed an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 196 U/l (reference range 10–45 U/l), an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 132 U/l (reference range 15–35 U/l) and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 127 U/l (reference range 35–105 U/l). Lipids were elevated: total cholesterol 4.5 mmol/l, high-density lipoprotein 0.84 mmol/l, low-density lipoprotein 2.4 mmol/l and triglycerides 2.86 mmol/l. Bilirubin, international normalized ratio and albumin were within normal ranges. The patient had no history of alcohol abuse nor did she take any herbal drug. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased echogenicity and poor visualization of the intrahepatic vessel walls, suggesting diffuse hepatic steatosis.\nStatins were discontinued and the patient was strongly encouraged to be compliant with her metformin treatment (1,000 mg twice-daily). In addition neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin was initiated. The daily dose of basal insulin was gradually increased to 30 IU once daily.\nAfter 8 weeks on metformin and insulin, HbA1c had markedly improved to 6.3%, but LFTs except for ALP remained elevated (ALT 133 U/l, AST 76 U/l, ALP 69 U/l). The patient was then scheduled for a liver biopsy, which showed hepatic fat infiltration involving more than 66% of hepatocytes, ballooned hepatocytes, lobular inflammation as well as pericellular and periportal fibrosis. The histological diagnosis was NASH with a NAFLD activity score of 5 (score range 0–8) and a fibrosis score of 2 (score range 0–4) (fig. ). Treatment with subcutaneous injections of the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide was initiated. The initial dose was 0.6 mg once daily subcutaneously. The dose was increased with weekly increments of 0.6–1.8 mg once daily during the following weeks. Liraglutide was well tolerated with no side effects such as nausea or vomiting. Insulin was gradually reduced and discontinued after 7 weeks.\nAfter 46 weeks of treatment with liraglutide, total weight loss was 16 kg, LFTs were in the lower normal range (ALT 29 U/l, AST 25 U/l, ALP 67 U/l), glycemic control was excellent (HbA1c 5.6%) and the lipid profile was normalized without statin treatment. Repeat abdominal ultrasound showed diminished echogenicity, suggesting an overall reduction in steatosis. A repeated liver biopsy confirmed decreased hepatic fat infiltration (involving 40–50% of hepatocytes), no ballooned hepatocytes and only distinct lobular inflammation (fig. ). The histology was no longer consistent with NASH, but pericellular and periportal fibrosis were still present (NAFLD activity score 3, fibrosis score 2).\nTo investigate the expression of hepatic GLP-1Rs in the present case, the baseline and the post-treatment liver biopsy were compared to liver tissue from another patient with type 2 diabetes but without steatosis, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta ratio?\n\nDelta Ratio: delta_ratio = delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

He was diagnosed with HIV initially in 1999, during hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The patient also had a history of facial herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) which has been recurrent and a history of pneumocystis pneumonia in June 2005. Previous laboratory studies from November 2006 revealed a CD4+ lymphocyte count of 20 and viral load HIV RNA of 65,833 copies/ml. He was a social drinker and had never used illicit drugs or tobacco products. HIV was presumed to be acquired sexually.\nOn initial assessment in the emergency department, he was cachectic but was in no acute distress. He had a fever of 38°C, blood pressure of 92/60 mmHg and regular pulse of 85 beats per minute. He was breathing at 20 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 95% on room air, which decreased to 90% during ambulation. There were no oral lesions. His neck was supple. Examination of the lungs revealed bilateral expiratory wheezes and rare rhonchi. Cardiac examination demonstrated normal first sound, second sound with a regular rhythm and no murmurs. His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds. His extremities were warm and his skin was dry with multiple small herpetic ulcers on the left ear and the left side of the face.\nLaboratory tests revealed the following concentrations: sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 26 mmol/L, BUN 2.9 mmol/L, creatinine 61 μmol/L, glucose 4.78 mmol/L, white blood cell 3.4 × 109/L, neutrophils 86%, hemoglobin 7.1 mmol/L, hematocrit 33%, platelets 322 × 109/L, LDH 497 U/L, CD4+ lymphocyte count of 2. Chest X-ray was negative for infiltrate (Figure ), but high resolution CT of the chest revealed subtle right middle lobe and right upper lobe ground-glass opacity (Figure ).\nThe patient was admitted to the medical ward with a working diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia. A sputum sample was collected spontaneously for a culture work-up (Bartlett score: +3). No sputum sample was collected for mycobacterial stains. Empiric treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1 tablet double-strength × 3 per day) and prednisone (40 mg × 2 per day) was started. The patient was also placed on treatment for HSV with acyclovir (400 mg × 3 per day). The prednisone doses were reduced as part of initial therapy for pneumocystis pneumonia. On the third day, direct fluorescent antibody test for Pneumocystis jiroveci was negative, but the culture was positive for Bordetella bronchiseptica. The patient was placed on droplet precautions; treatment was switched to levofloxacin (400 mg per day). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole dose was modified to (1 tablet single-strength per day) for pneumocystis prophylaxis and azithromycin (1200 mg once per week) for Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis began. The patient subsequently improved on levofloxacin and on the seventh day was discharged home on levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, and acyclovir. After eleven days, the patient visited our office. The patient had no complaints, no fever and no cough and his shortness of breath was fully resolved.

He was a smoker with diabetes and chronic kidney disease Class 3a with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 48 mL/min/m2. The hospital had no coronary intervention facilities, so he received thrombolytic therapy. Two weeks later, he presented to our emergency department with typical chest pain and exertional dyspnoea (New York Heart Association Class III). He was on dual antiplatelet therapy, Bisoprolol, Atorvastatin, and Isosorbide dinitrates. There was no echocardiogram report with the patient.\nAuscultation confirmed a harsh pansystolic murmur V/VI on his left parasternal area and across the precordium. He had bilateral, fine basal crepitations. His heart rate was 88 b.p.m. and blood pressure was 115/67 mmHg.\nTransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) demonstrated an akinetic inferior wall and inferior septum with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. A large, true aneurysm in the mid-cavity inferior wall was identified by its wide neck and contracting muscle layer ( and ). The inferior septum was ruptured and dissected with a large, left-to-right shunt ( and ). A TOE X-plane transgastric short-axis view in diastole showed an inferior wall aneurysm with a wide neck of 2 cm (). The aneurysm cavity connected to the RV through the ruptured part of the inferior septum, creating an LV-to-RV-to-aneurysm communication ( and ). We noted mild tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 75 mmHg. RV function was mildly reduced (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of 1.6 cm). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed non-viable inferior segments, and a 4.2 cm × 4.3 cm × 5.8 cm cavitary lesion. The LV showed a mid-inferior and inferoseptal wide-neck true aneurysm () with a focal area of ventricular septal rupture in the inferior aspect of the aneurysm with a turbulent high-velocity flow across it (). The patient’s coronary angiography displayed tight proximal and middle right coronary artery lesions, as well as a severe ostial left main, a severe mid-left anterior descending artery lesion, and severe ramus intermedius disease.\nThe patient was considered high surgical risk because of his age, general condition, renal impairment, and difficult anatomy of the post-infarct VSD and aneurysm. Transcatheter closure of the post-infarct VSD and inferior wall aneurysm was performed. Because of the two different pathologies, we closed the VSD first using an antegrade approach from the venous side. Next, we closed the neck of the aneurysm using a retrograde approach from the arterial side. A Terumo guidewire (260 cm) was introduced from the right common femoral vein. The wire passed from the RV to the inferior wall aneurysm to the LV and finally to the aorta. We then exchanged the Terumo guidewire with an Amplatzer stiff guidewire (260 cm).\nWe used an 8 French Amplatzer delivery sheath to deploy an 18-mm ASO (AGA Medical Corporation, USA) to close the VSD completely (, and ). We selected the size based on TOE measurements. The RV-to-aneurysm communication measured 14 mm, so we oversized the ASO device by 4 mm to fit inside the defect. The aneurysm was engaged in retrograde from the LV using a 6 French PG catheter introduced from the right common femoral artery and over the Terumo guidewire (260 cm), which was then replaced by a Confida stiff guidewire (Medtronic) of the same length. We cannulated the inferior aneurysm mouth with a Torque-Vue 10 F/45 delivery sheath. The ASO (26 mm) device was deployed with a large disc in the aneurysm (, and ). We selected the size based on the TOE measurement. The aneurysm mouth measured 20 mm, so we increased the ASO length by 6 mm to fit inside the aneurysm. We assured enough distance between the aneurysm mouth and the mitral valve so that the deployed disc would not affect the mitral valve. Both devices were established with the aneurysm device resting on the post-infarct VSD device ( and ).\nLeft ventricular (LV) injection and TOE showed complete occlusion of the post-infarct VSD and aneurysm. Both devices established contact and showed the angulated relation of their two different planes (, and ). The akinetic inferior wal procedure and fluoroscopy times were 60 min and 25 min, respectively, and the total contrast amount was 40 mL. The patient recovered uneventfully within 6 days in the intensive care unit. As EF was 45%, we selected to do full revascularization. The patient underwent complete revascularization for his right coronary artery, left main artery, proximal left anterior descending artery, and ramus intermedius (). The patient was discharged after 14 days. At his 3-month follow-up, he remained well with reasonable exercise tolerance, NYHA Class I. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no flow across the devices, no residual shunt, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%, akinetic inferior wall, and inferior septum (, and ). The systolic pulmonary artery pressure improved to 35 mmHg (). His renal function remained stable at follow-up with GFR 46 mL/min/m2.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?\n\nMean Arterial Pressure (MAP): MAP = 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure)",

The first episode was a sudden onset of complete paralysis below distal thigh, and he had no other symptoms except leg paralysis. At a local clinic, physical examination revealed symmetric hyporeflexia in both lower extremities. Laboratory analysis revealed mild hypokalemia as below: Na+, 146 mmol/L; K+, 2.7 mmol/L; Cl-, 110 mmol/L; tCO2, 25 mmol/L without abnormality of blood gas analysis. Electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia without atrioventricular block or prominent U wave. However, further evaluation for hypokalemia was not taken, even though there was a suggestion of hypokalemic paralysis, and the patient was just advised to eat an adequate dietary supplement of potassium rich food without any medication by the local clinic. After two weeks, a second episode of leg weakness occurred after morning meal. The muscle weakness was initially subtle but progressed in paralysis below knee and lasted for 6 hours. Thus, he was referred to our hospital. However, the patient visited our clinic the next day, when the paralysis had already subsided.\nThere was no past history or family history of neuromuscular disease and endocrinologic disease, except for his aunt's hypothyroidism. His appearance was reasonably healthy. His height was 168 cm, his weight was 60 kg, and his body mass index was 21.2 kg/m2. His blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg, his respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and his body temperature was 36.8℃. He had mild tachycardia with a heart rate of 100-110 beats/min,, but he had no palpitations. Neurological examination findings, including deep tendon reflex and cerebellar function test, were normal. The laboratory findings showed normal complete blood cell counts, normal electrolytes as below: Na+, 140 mmol/L; K+, 4.4 mmol/L; Cl-, 104 mmol/L; tCO2, 24 mmol/L. The laboratory findings also showed his normal liver, kidney and cardiac functions. His urine K+ excretion rate was normally low as 0.96 of urine K+/Cr ratio (range, 0-2). There were no abnormal laboratory findings to suggest adrenal hormone excess or primary hyperaldosteronism: adrenocorticotropic hormone, 40.11 pg/mL (range, 3.5-13.2 pg/mL); cortisol, 8.7 µg/dL (range, 5.0-23.0 µg/dL); 17 hydroxyprogesterone, 2.68 ng/mL (range, 0.6-3.42 ng/mL); aldosterone, 180.29 pg/mL (range, 38.9-306.8 pg/mL); renin, 6.13 ng/mL/hr (range, 1.31-3.95 ng/mL/hr); epinephrine, 0.030 ng/mL (range, 0-0.30 ng/mL); norepinephrine, 0.087 ng/mL (range, 0-0.80 ng/mL). Thyroid function test (TFT) revealed a hyperthyroidism: serum free thyroxine (fT4), 2.10 ng/dL (range, 0.70-1.48 ng/dL); triiodothyronine (T3), 2.95 ng/mL (range, 0.58-1.59 ng/mL); thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), <0.025 mU/L (range, 0.35-4.94 mU/L). Thus, he was diagnosed as having hypokalemic paralysis due to hyperthyroidim. Serum TSH receptor antibodies were high at 6.05 IU/L (range, 0-1.75 IU/L), thyroid stimulating antibody was positive, and thyroid ultrasonography revealed diffuse enlarged thyroid and increased vascularity. These findings were consistent with Graves' disease as etiology of his hyperthyroidism. He was initially treated with lower dose of an antithyroid drug (methimazole 5 mg once daily) than usual, since his thyrotoxic symptoms and signs were absent, and his level of serum fT4 was not prominent. In addition, a β-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) was simultaneously used for preventing the paralysis. After two weeks, a follow-up TFT revealed aggravated hyperthyroidism, and he was treated with increased dose of antithyroid drugs. After two months, since his heart rate and blood pressure were stable and he had no symptoms of palpitations, β-blockers were discontinued successfully. No paralysis has occurred for one year, as hyperthyroidism can be well controlled with antithyroid drugs ().\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?\n\nMaintenance Fluids Calculations: maintenance_fluid = base_value + weight_coefficient * weight, where base_value is 60 ml/hr for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 40 ml/hr for patients with a weight between 10kg and 20kg, and 0 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg, and weight_coefficient is 1 for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 2 for patients  with a weight between between 10kg and 20kg, and 4 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg",

During these 8 years, she was diagnosed with uterus didelphys with two cervices and no vaginal septum (Fig. ). She underwent hysterosalpingogram (HSG), three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US), and diagnostic laparoscopy, which proved the diagnosis (Fig. ). Hence, no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done since the 3D US was enough to determine the sizes of both horns, which showed minor differences in dimensions.\nShe had no specific history, apart from her irregular period explained by the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), was not a smoker, and did not consume alcohol. Her weight was 87 kg and her height 158 cm.\nHer spouse was 44 years old, with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, a recent history of coronary angioplasty and stents, and chronic hypertension.\nThey had three previous failed intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) trials outside our center years prior due to an indication for a male factor (oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia).\nThe couple was very anxious, depressed, and distressed at the first consultation, to which they brought a new semen analysis showing azoospermia.\nThe male, who had a medical condition, declined any intervention to extract the sperm surgically per recommendations from the anesthesiologists and cardiologists. A diagnosis of retrograde ejaculation was made, as well as a plan for isolation of the sperm from a urine sample after the preparation. Three vials of frozen motile sperm were obtained before embarking on the fourth IVF trial.\nFour blastocysts were obtained from the first IVF/ICSI antagonist cycle in February 2018 (Table ), one of which (4AA) was transferred to the left uterus, and surplus freezing was done. The patient tolerated the procedure very well with no need for sedation or anesthesia. Her vital signs were normal (blood pressure 118/67 mmHg, heart rate 73 beats per minute, temperature 36.7 °C).\nBoth horns had a highly suitable endometrium, with a triple line with an average thickness of 10.3 mm. The left horn was chosen because it was more accessible to the left cervix at the moment of embryo transfer. It was planned to transfer one embryo, and the couple was counseled by our high-risk-pregnancy consultant to improve the obstetrics outcome for this uterine anomaly.\nThe first successful IVF journey ended with no need for cerclage and with no obstetrical complication by an elective C-section at 35 weeks for a baby girl of 2800 g weight, 46 cm length, 31.5 cm head circumference, and 7/10 Apgar score at delivery.\nThe couple visited our infertility center again in 2020 with the goal of conceiving a second child. The first child was with them, showing very good progress, normal development, and intelligence as per her parents. They extended their request to transfer one of the frozen embryos.\nThe endometrium was prepared by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) protocol for embryo transfer for the frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle using 6 mg ethinyl estradiol daily starting from second day of period. Progesterone was added on day 14, when reaching triple-line endometrium with thickness of 11.1 mm. One blastocyst was thawed and survived. The initial decision was to transfer the embryo to the same horn (left) because of the previous successful transfer. The very deep and long vagina forced us to reach one of the cervices. The outer sheet of the embryo transfer catheter was used and showed that we were targeting the right horn.\nEmbryo transfer proceeded successfully and smoothly (Fig. ), in which the embryo was placed in the right uterus without changing or manipulating the anatomy, and the embryo was placed 1 cm from fundus. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and the couple was counseled properly.\nNine days later, her beta human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG) level was 258 mIU/ml. A single gestational sac with a viable pregnancy (positive heart beat) was observed in the right uterus, and the patient was referred to our high-risk-pregnancy specialist for follow-up.

An electrocardiogram suggested nonspecific ST-T wave changes with premature atrial contractions.\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism was suspected, and therefore, a captopril challenge test and a saline infusion test were performed. All these investigations revealed positive test results (Table ), which confirmed a diagnosis of PA. A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test to exclude the diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome was negative. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a left adrenal mass (13 mm) (Figure ). In adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated AVS, although aldosterone hypersecretion was observed in the left adrenal gland, the lateralization of the disease was not determined due to incomplete cannulation of the right adrenal vein (Table ). The criteria of successful cannulation were based on the current Expert Consensus Statement.\n131I-adosterol scintigraphy under dexamethasone suppression showed an equivalently increased uptake in both adrenal glands (Figure ). Because we could not exclude the bilateral PA, including aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) with microadenoma in the right adrenal gland, we performed the medical therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA). Although we administrated multiple antihypertensive agents including an MRA (eplerenone at 100 mg/d), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (azilsartan at 40 mg/d), a dual action beta blocker/alpha-1 blocker (carvedilol at 20 mg/d), a calcium channel blocker with an increased dose (nifedipine at 80 mg/d), an alpha-1 blocker (doxazosin at 2 mg/d), and an alpha-2 agonist (guanabenz at 4 mg/d), a home reading of the patient's blood pressure was above 140/90 mm Hg. Moreover, he needed a large quantity of potassium chloride to compensate for his hypokalemia.\nDespite intensive medical therapy, he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention due to stable angina. Following this, we performed AVS again, but the right adrenal vein was not successfully cannulated (Table ). We discussed further the indication for surgery and decided to remove the left adrenal gland. After laparoscopic left adrenalectomy, his blood pressure and serum potassium remained normal after the withdrawal of eplerenone, doxazosin, guanabenz, and potassium chloride and a dose reduction of azilsartan (at 20 mg/d), carvedilol (at 10 mg/d), and nifedipine (at 10 mg/d). The PRA and PAC were 0.8 ng/mL/h and 57.1 pg/mL, 3 months after the adrenalectomy, respectively. Macroscopic findings of the resected specimen showed a yellowish colored nodule (13 mm in diameter) in the adrenal gland. We confirmed a diagnosis of an adrenocortical adenoma based on a histopathologic examination (Figure ); we also confirmed that the tumor cells were rich in the cytoplasm and were eosinophilic without malignant cells.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

Surgical history was significant for excision of sublingual glands. Family history: mother was HIV positive; both mother and father had significant history of substance abuse. She drank one to two alcoholic drinks per week and was an everyday smoker, between 1/4 pack and 1/2 pack per day. Her vital signs were significant for tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Lower extremity examination was positive for tender lower extremities with no palpable dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, and popliteal pulses bilaterally. Initial lab tests were significant for lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury, EKG with nonspecific ST-T wave changes (), elevated troponin, 1.08 ng/ml, peaked at 3.5 ng/ml and urine drug screen was positive for methamphetamine and marijuana. Hemoglobin 11.9 gm/dl, white blood cells 10.4, platelets 178, sodium 139 mmol/liter, potassium 4.1 mmol/liter, chloride 104 mmol/liter, bicarbonate 20 mmol/liter, BUN 11 mg/dl, creatinine 1.3 mg/liter, blood glucose 141 mg/dl, AST 68 units/liter, ALT 41 units/liter, total bilirubin 0.9 grams/dl, alkaline phosphatase 107 IU/liter, and INR 1.8.

CT angiogram showed large segment aortic occlusion (4 cm) just beyond the renal arteries and partial occlusive thrombus in the superior mesenteric artery with early ischemia (Figures and ). There were also multiple areas of bilateral renal infarcts left greater than right with the main renal arteries patent bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an echo dense mass, 2.4 cm × 2.8 cm, 1.2 cm × 2.0 cm in size, in the left ventricle with defined margins that are distinct from the endocardium seen throughout systole and diastole, consistent with left ventricular thrombus (Figures –). Ejection fraction was estimated to be 15 %, with increased wall thickness and grade 3 diastolic dysfunction. There was mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with normal valve structure. CT head was obtained due to an altered mental status which was negative for acute bleeding. The patient became profoundly hypotensive which was likely due to cardiogenic shock despite being on maximum vasopressors. She developed limb ischemia due to compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. Interventional radiology and vascular surgery were consulted, surgical thrombectomy was done.

His wife called an ambulance and had him brought to our ED as she noticed he was short of breath for the prior 12 hours. He did not have any symptoms suggestive of a recent upper respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis. He denied exposure to sick contacts, recent immunizations, or consumption of canned foods or beverages. He did have a past medical history significant for esophageal stricture (diagnosed 2 years before) for which he had been undergoing routine endoscopic balloon dilation (last attempt was 3 months before). He lived in a rural upstate New York county and had retired as a meat-cutter 15 years before. His only medications at the time were ferrous sulfate (324 mg daily), pantoprazole (40 mg twice daily), and a multivitamin. He did not have a history of tobacco smoking. He consumed approximately two standard drinks in a week. He had no known allergies. While in our ED, his vital signs were: temperature, 37 ºC (98.6 ºF); heart rate, 100–110 beats per minute; blood pressure, 141/82 mmHg; and oxygen saturation 82% on room air and requiring 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) via facemask to maintain saturations above 96%. On physical examination, he was in marked respiratory distress but not toxic-appearing. He was awake but drowsy, oriented only to self. His pupils were equal and symmetrical with appropriate response to light. His extra-ocular movements were intact. There was no facial droop; there was no deviation of tongue or uvula. His gag reflex was impaired. He could move all four extremities spontaneously and on command. However, motor strength appeared to be symmetrically and mildly diminished in all extremities and accompanied by decreased tone. Diminished knee and ankle reflexes were noted bilaterally. He had a diminished flexor plantar response bilaterally. Sensation was grossly intact in his face, trunk, and extremities. Coordination was impaired in upper and lower extremities with dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was not assessed. He had no visible involuntary movements. His neck was supple without signs of meningismus. A cardiovascular examination was unremarkable, with normal heart sounds and equal symmetrical pulses in bilateral extremities. His abdominal, musculoskeletal, and skin examinations were unremarkable. Although he was hemodynamically stable, he became lethargic with stridor and progressive hypoxia. Given concern for airway protection, he was emergently intubated with a 7.5 mm endotracheal tube on first attempt and placed on mechanical ventilatory support. For intubation, he was administered 1.5 mg/kg of succinylcholine and 0.3 mg/kg of etomidate intravenously. Maintenance fluids (normal saline at 125 cc/hour) and empiric intravenous administration of ceftriaxone at a dose of 2 g every 24 hours (to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia) was initiated. He was transferred to our intensive care unit for further management. A nasopharyngolaryngoscopy revealed bilateral true vocal cord paralysis. After stabilization on a ventilator, he underwent a tracheostomy on day 3 of admission and was transitioned successfully to a tracheostomy collar. Following extubation, he had consistent and gradual recovery of mental status. This was not, however, accompanied by any progressive improvement in motor function. He continued to have vocal cord immobility and flaccid weakness of his extremities.\nOn presentation, laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count, 13,800 cells/μL; hemoglobin, 14.7 g/dl; platelet count, 235,000 cells/μL; sodium, of 143 mmol/L; potassium, 4.2 mmol/L; chloride, 105 mmol/L; glucose, 176 mg/dL; bicarbonate, 27 mmol/L; creatinine, 0.53 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 15 mg/dL; and calcium, 8.0 mg/dL. A hepatic function panel revealed a total protein level, 5.2 g/dL; serum albumin, 3.5 g/dL; total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 18 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 21 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.08; creatine kinase, 127 U/L; and troponin I less than 0.015 ng/mL. Urine analysis demonstrated cloudy urine with specific gravity 1.018, pH 4.8, with 116 red blood cells (RBCs) and 4 white blood cells (WBCs), negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite. An electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were unremarkable. A urine drug screen and serum alcohol levels were negative. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and cortisol levels were within normal limits. Thiamine, vitamin B6, and B12 levels were normal. Serological tests were negative for Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Blood and urine cultures obtained at presentation showed no growth. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of his head and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain were normal except for mild ventriculomegaly (Fig. ). CT angiography of his head and neck revealed patent intracranial vasculature. A repetitive nerve stimulation electromyographic (EMG) study demonstrated patchy, moderate to severe, peripheral motor nerve denervation consistent with AIDP. A lumbar puncture was performed and analysis of the obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed albuminocytologic dissociation with less than 3 nucleated cells per mL of fluid, elevated CSF protein of 62 mg/dl, and normal glucose levels (88 mg/dl). CSF cultures did not demonstrate any growth. Anti-GQ1B antibody and anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels were negative.\nA subacute presentation with ataxia, stridor with respiratory distress, and areflexia with weakness of bilateral upper and lower extremity offers a challenging differential (Table ).\nIt is prudent to first rule out an acute vascular cause such as stroke, especially involving the cerebellum and brainstem; for example, for example, an absence of any lateralizing neurological signs and disturbed consciousness would rule out stroke, especially one with brainstem involvement. Next, metabolic abnormalities due to alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies, or electrolyte deficiencies would be evident on a metabolic panel and on serum vitamin and ethyl alcohol levels. An absence of a suggestive history of exposure to Clostridium botulinum, such as consumption of canned or tinned foods, cosmetic use of botulinum toxin injection, or intravenous drug use, significantly lowers the possibility of botulism. An absence of fever and meningeal signs, and analysis of CSF obtained on lumbar puncture, can rule out meningitis and encephalitis. Spinal cord trauma and spinal shock in the initial stages would result in flaccid paralysis of extremities aside from obvious signs of trauma. Also, concomitant bulbar paralysis is highly unlikely. Overlapping autoimmune demyelinating syndromes such as Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and Bickerstaff’s brainstem encephalitis (BBE) must be considered. GBS is more likely to have a characteristic pattern of ascending paralysis. BBE is considered to lie on the same spectrum as MFS as it may present with ataxia and ophthalmoplegia and can have positive anti-GQ1b antibodies. However, BBE is characterized more by hyperreflexia and somnolence. New-onset MG can be suspected but, in our patient, motor involvement was patchy, the anti-AChR antibody test result was negative, and EMG was not suggestive of MG.\nBased on the above, a diagnosis of MFS involving the bulbar muscles was made and our patient was started on a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin at a daily dose of 0.4 mg/kg body weight per day. Following completion of this course, he showed clinical improvement in phonation, overall muscle strength, as well as tone. Although he initially did require overnight ventilatory support through his tracheostomy, the need for this gradually diminished and he was weaned off the ventilator altogether.\nSubsequent follow-up laryngoscopies after 1, 2, and 4 weeks showed improvement in vocal cord abduction. His overall respiratory status also improved with decreasing oxygen requirement and decreased need for tracheostomy suctioning. He continued to have moderate pharyngeal dysphagia and required placement of a jejunostomy tube for feeding. His hospitalization was also complicated with development of aspiration pneumonia. He was eventually discharged to a skilled nursing facility on a tracheostomy collar and jejunostomy tube after a total of 6 weeks of hospitalization and subsequently discharged home after making suitable progress in physical rehabilitation. He continued to follow-up with the physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) out-patient clinic and remained tracheostomy-dependent at 6 months following hospitalization. He was able to ambulate with a walker at that time.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Delta Ratio: albumin_corrected_delta_ratio = albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

The patient also complained of general pruritus but no malaise, joint pain or muscle pain. Body temperature, respiration, and pulse were normal. His blood pressure was elevated at 182/94 mm Hg. His body height, body weight, and body mass index were 165 cm, 52 kg, and 19.1, respectively.\nOn physical examination, a firm, superficial, erythematous nodule measuring approximately 1 × 2 cm was noted within the lower, inner quadrant of the right breast. There was no nipple discharge, history of trauma, or cancer history. Given the possibility of breast carcinoma, the patient was admitted for further evaluation. Upon admission, initial laboratory results revealed: BUN, 40 mg/dl; creatinine, 28.63 mg/dl, C-reactive protein, 7.04 mg/L; hemoglobin, 6.3 g/dl; and a white blood count, 6700 /ml, with a left shift.\nChest X-ray upon admission showed increased patchy infiltrates bilaterally and a non-contrast chest CT was performed for further evaluation. The chest CT revealed diffuse patchy airspace consolidation and patchy pulmonary alveolar infiltrates with fine interstitial thickening over both lung fields, most severe within the left upper lobe and right lower lobe (Figure ). The primary diagnosis was atypical pneumonia. Differential diagnosis included asymmetric pulmonary edema and multifocal bronchoalveolar carcinoma.\nSputum culture, sputum cytology, serum mycoplasma antibody, and legionella antibody were performed. Azithromycin and augmentin were begun for possible atypical pneumonia. Sputum cytology was negative for malignant cells. Sputum culture, however, revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca (without tubercle bacillus). Appropriate antibiotic therapy was continued and repeat serial chest X-rays, performed during his hospital stay, showed resolution of the alveolar infiltrates, bilaterally.\nIncidentally noted on chest CT was a small oval nodular lesion measuring approximately 1.0 cm × 0.6 cm over the inferior and medial aspect of the right breast with infiltration within the subcutaneous adipose tissue (Figure ). As the nature of the breast nodule was unclear, a breast ultrasound (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) was recommended for further evaluation. Breast sonography revealed an oval, heterogeneous, predominantly hypoechoic nodule within the right breast measuring 1.35 cm × 0.39 cm in size between 3 and 4 o’clock, 2 cm from the nipple, with a faint echogenic interface, partially indistinct margin, and increased blood flow signals on color Doppler (Figure ). Skin thickening and additional hypoechoic satellite nodules were noted in the surrounding area (Figure ). As this presentation was felt to be unusual in a male breast, breast malignancy was suspected. As the patient refused mammography or MRI, a sono-guided biopsy of the lesion was performed using an 18-gauge core biopsy needle (Figure ). Pathology from four strips tissue revealed fibroadipose tissue and hemorrhage with inflammatory cell infiltration. As the pathology was considered indeterminant, an excisional biopsy of the mass was performed. Pathology from the excisional biopsy confirmed breast panniculitis, consisting of fibroadipose tissue with prominent inflammation and fibrotic change in a vague perivascular pattern (Figure ). Hemorrhage and hemosiderin deposition were also present. Histologic section further revealed a vasculitis involving medium size arteries and small vessels without giant cells or granuloma formation (Figure ).\nMycoplasma antibody titer, legionella antibody titer, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), autoimmune markers, carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen 15–3, prostatic specific antigen, immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin A, human immunodeficiency virus antibody titer, hepatitis C antibody titer, and hepatitis B surface antigen titer were all negative. A non-contrast head CT was also negative, performed as part of a headache work-up. Renal sonogram revealed increased cortical echogenicity of both kidneys compatible with chronic renal parenchymal disease. No definite renal infarctions were identified.\nThe lesion within the right breast resolved after excisional biopsy without further treatment. As the diagnosis was compatible with an isolated breast panniculitis with vasculitis (BPWV), the patient did not receive systemic corticosteroids or anti-inflammatory therapy during admission or after discharge and his breast symptoms did not recur during the subsequent 5 years of clinical follow-up.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

She was afebrile, normotensive and maintaining optimal oxygen saturation on room air. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory testing showed white blood cell count of 5.1 × 103/µL, haemoglobin 10.8 g/dl, haematocrit 32.4% and platelet count 276 × 103/µL. Comprehensive metabolic panel revealed serum sodium 141 mmol/L, potassium 4.4 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 31 mmol/L, BUN 12 mg/dl, creatinine 0.6 mg/dl, calcium 9.3 mg/dl, bilirubin total 0.5 mg/dl, AST 15 mg/dl, ALT 6 mg/dl, ALP 78 mg/dl, total protein 7 g/dl of which albumin was 3.5 g/dl. Serum Β2-microglobulin was 3.3 mg/L. Thyroid function tests and iron studies were within normal limits. Chest x-ray () revealed right lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion. In comparison, an old chest x-ray performed 3 years ago showed no active lung disease (). Computerized tomography of the chest without IV contrast () on second day of hospital stay revealed moderate right-sided pleural effusion and right lower lobe consolidation. Treatment with levofloxacin was started. She was clinically stable and was discharged with a plan to continue antibiotic for total duration of 7 days. She was scheduled for follow up with chest clinic in 2 weeks. The patient came back after 2 months for follow up at chest clinic. She reported unchanged cough and worsening shortness of breath. Since her symptoms were worsening, she was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On the second hospital admission vital signs were stable, chest CT scan () revealed no significant change in complete consolidation of right lower lobe as compared to previous chest CT scan there was a moderate right-sided pleural effusion and new right upper lobe infiltrate. Abdomen and pelvis CT scan revealed homogeneous attenuation of the liver. Size and contour were maintained with no focal lesions, the pancreas was intact without ductal dilatation, the spleen was normal in size, the adrenal glands were intact, no enlarged lymph nodes were found, no ascites was present and no worrisome osseous lesions were demonstrated. PET/CT scan revealed 2.5 cm infiltrate in right upper lobe and another larger lesion in right lower lobe, both with significant uptake. Moderate right pleural effusion. Bronchoscopy showed polypoid nodularities surrounded by black discoloured mucosa in the sub-segmental bronchi of the right lower lobe, transbronchial biopsy specimen revealed minute fragments of respiratory epithelium with atypical B cell-rich lymphocytes with no evidence of amyloid deposition. Polymerase chain reaction confirmed a clonal B cell gene rearrangement, findings suggestive of low-grade B cell lymphoma. Pleural fluid was sampled and analysis revealed straw-coloured fluid, pH 7.3, white blood cell count of 6400 cells, red cell count of 3750, fluid albumin of 2.2 g/dl (serum albumin 3.0 g/dl), fluid lactate dehydrogenase 52 IU/L (serum lactate dehydrogenase 199 IU/l). Pleural fluid cytology () with immunophenotypic flow cytometry revealed plasmacytoid lymphocytes. Serum immunofixation and free light-chain analysis unveiled large quantity of monoclonal paraproteins which was classified as IgM Kappa immunoglobulin. Concentration of IgM was 1491 mg/dl (range 26–217 mg/dl) while IgG and IgA levels were normal. Urine contained free kappa light chains. The clinical picture, serum IgM paraprotein, bronchoscopy specimen findings and pleural fluid analysis led to the diagnosis of Extramedullary Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia. Patient was started on cyclophosphamide, prednisone and rituximab. Plan was to follow up with IgM level monthly and Chest CT scan after four months.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Delta Ratio: albumin_corrected_delta_ratio = albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

Initial examination revealed agitation and bilateral pupil mydriasis with positive pupillary response to light. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis: pH = 6.80, PaCO2 = 30.4 mm Hg, HCO3 = 4.6 mEq/L, Na = 139 mEq/L, Cl = 108 mEq/L. The metabolic acidosis in this patient could not be explained solely by lactic acidosis following seizure activity so other potential causes were explored. A thorough history of the patient’s family revealed that the patient drank homemade alcohol three days prior to presentation. Methanol poisoning was diagnosed on the basis of the previously mentioned history and initial evaluation and the decision was made to begin hemodialysis. Due to the history of head trauma, a computed tomography scan (CT scan) of the brain was performed prior to sending the patient to the dialysis unit (). Protective measures including ethanol gavage, folic acid, and sodium bicarbonate were administered to the patient while waiting to begin hemodialysis. Hemodialysis was then performed for four hours. Following hemodialysis, the patient’s acidosis was reduced, and the clinical features were improved. Approximately one hour later, the patient’s level of consciousness decreased and unilateral mydriasis with negative pupillary light response (anisocoria) developed in the right eye. The patient was immediately intubated and brain CT scan was repeated (). A large epidural hematoma was seen in the right fronto-parietal lobe with evidence of mass effect.

The physical exam showed an obese, lethargic patient, responsive to verbal stimuli. The lung, heart, and abdomen exam were unremarkable and there was no neck crepitus noted. The laboratory evaluation showed leukocytosis of 25.96 x 1000/mm3, elevated creatinine of 2.17 mg/dL, hyperglycemia of 836 mg/dL, hyponatremia of 128 mEq/L, hyperkalemia of 5.2 mEq/L, and bicarbonate of 5 mEq/L. The anion gap was 25 and a venous blood gas showed a pH of 6.91. Urinalysis was positive for 2+ ketones and 1+ protein.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus complicated with DKA. Intravenous normal saline, bicarbonate, and insulin drip were initiated. The chest X-ray on admission suggested findings compatible with pneumomediastinum (Figure ). Chest computed tomography (CT) was obtained and reaffirmed the findings (Figures -). Pneumomediastinum in the setting of intractable vomiting was worrisome for esophageal rupture and since our facility was not staffed to manage this clinical entity, the patient was emergently transferred to another facility.

Before this, he was healthy and did not have a history of digestive diseases, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The man was a native of Chongqing, the subtropical area in southwest China. He used to be a soldier; he fought in the Vietnam War and joined the police force after returning to his hometown.\nIn the hospital, his initial vitals were BP 108/78 mmHg, HR 111, respiratory rate 22, and oxygen saturation 98%. Initial laboratories included white blood cells 13.32 × 109/L (neutrophils% 77.5%; lymphocytes% 13.31%; eosinophils% 0.5%), normal hemoglobin and platelets, albumin (ALB) 14.5 g/L, globulin (GLB) 19.9 g/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 78.7 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 90.9 IU/L, creatinine (Cr) 134 μmol/L, 24-hour urine protein 9.61 g, and negative antinuclear antibody spectrum (ANAs) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Chest X-ray showed mild emphysema but no sign of infection. The patient was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome but was unable to undergo pathological biopsy due to a renal cyst. He was administered full-dose glucocorticoid therapy alone, with no other immunosuppression. Three weeks later, while still under this treatment, the patient suffered lower limb cellulitis. His procalcitonin (PCT) was 0.3 ng/ml, and he was administrated mupirocin ointment and IV cefuroxime. After those treatments, his status improved and he continued to take oral glucocorticoids after discharge from the hospital.\nHowever, over the next ten days, the patient seemed to get worse and had to return to the hospital due to persistent fever, cough, and intermittent abdominal pain. Initial vitals on admission were temperature 37.8 °C, BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 125, respiratory rate 26, and oxygen saturation 95%. Laboratory tests showed white blood cells 12.36 × 109/L (neutrophils %: 83.5%; eosinophils %: 0.7%). Sputum smear and culture were negative. Imaging examinations included CT scans of the chest, which reported interstitial pneumonia (Fig. ), and the abdomen, which reported no specific findings. The patient was diagnosed with normal gastrointestinal discomfort and pulmonary bacterial infection. A proton pump inhibitor, cefoperazone sodium, and sulbactam sodium were administered. However, the patient then started display hemoptysis, passed occult blood-positive stool, and gradually fell into a state of hyperpyrexia and drowsiness. Soon, Klebsiella pneumoniae (which was sensitized to the previous antibiotic), and unexpectedly, a large number of S. stercoralis larvae (Fig. ) were found in repeated sputum specimens. Meanwhile, the parasite was also found in a repeated brown stool specimen. Blood samples showed eosinophils% reached 18.1% and PCT was 1.01 ng/ml. Because ivermectin is not available in our region, albendazole (400 mg/day) was administered for 3 consecutive days but there was no progress. Subsequently, a mechanical ventilator was administered due to continued severe hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient was unable to maintain his blood pressure and eventually died after co-infection with S stercoralis hyperinfection and the K pneumoniae found 1 week later.

Half a month before hospitalization, she complained of double eyelid droop and diplopia; the ocular weakness and fatigue was stable throughout the day and had nothing to do with physical activity. The local hospital suspected myasthenia gravis, a computed tomography scan of her brain revealed nothing, and her serum was collected to detect the acetylcholine antibody. While waiting for a hospital bed, she developed numbness in her right upper and lower extremities. At the same time, she presented with prolonged sleep duration and mental symptoms. She was then transferred to our institution. On admission, she was noted to have difficulty walking by herself due to truncal ataxia. There was no cold, fever, or diarrhea before her symptom onset.\nShe had been suffering from chronic anemia, and her family reported that she had dietary deficiencies due to poor appetite although she denied it herself. She was on no other medications, not pregnant, and did not use alcohol or illicit drugs.\nOn physical examination, the patient presented obviously unbalanced nutrition; she was 1.65 m in height yet only weighed 40 kg. She was conscious and oriented and scored 23 in the MMSE, mainly due to impaired memory and calculation performance. Eye signs were obvious; she had drooping eyelids (both 5 mm). The ophthalmoplegia was remarkable; she demonstrated bilateral abducens nerve palsies and adduction deficit of both eyes. Limitation and nystagmus on vertical gaze were also noted. There was slight dysmetria on both finger–nose and heel–shin testing. Limb dysdiadochokinesia was also observed. Bilateral pyramidal signs were positive. Sensory examination indicated hyperesthesia on the right side. Findings on muscle tone and strength tests were normal.\nShe had an abnormal Hb level of 92 g/L, accompanied by low levels of serum folate and ferritin; vitamin B12 level was normal. Laboratory tests also revealed elevated levels of CA199 and CA242; both were gastrointestinal tumor markers although an abdominal enhanced CT scan reported no findings. The CSF revealed an increased white blood cell count of 28/mL (dominantly lymphocytes); other routine analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were normal, including protein level and IgG index (0.49). Also, no oligoclonal bands were found. Additional laboratory workup—including rheumatology analysis—was negative.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain () showed symmetric T2 hyperintensities predominantly located within periaqueductal gray matter and periventricular regions of the fourth ventricles. A diffusion-weighted sequence also showed a hyperintense signal along the floor of the fourth ventricle. The presence of a lateral ventricle lesion was also noted. All brain lesions did not show contrast enhancement. Nerve conduction studies and visual evoked potentials were normal.\nIn view of the possible diagnosis of WE, thiamine was started intramuscularly (300 mg 12-h). However, poor clinical recovery was observed. Her mental status worsened and exhibited hallucination, and the ocular palsy also progressed.\nThen came the crucial result that her serum and cerebral fluid tested positive for NMOSD-IgG (1:32 and 1:3.2, respectively). Thereafter, the spinal cord was evaluated, and MRI of the spine revealed a suspicious enhanced T2-weighted signal at the lower thoracic cord region ().\nWe corrected the diagnosis, and the patient started with treatment of high-dose intravenous steroids, but still little improvement was detected. The patient then experienced bilateral visual loss, but MRI results of the optic nerve reported no findings. After that, intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was given, followed by intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy.

He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.\nCreatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior.

Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.\nHis chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.\nRenal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%.

Physical assessment revealed blood pressure of 210/110 mmHg, temperature 38.3°C, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, heart rate of 100 beats per minute.\nArterial blood gas showed PaO2 137 mm of Hg, PCO2 43 mm of Hg, pH 7.37 and bicarbonate 24.6 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, sodium 143 mmol/L, choride 103 mmol/L, anion gap 19 mmol/l, calcium 1.12 mmol/l, glucose 108 mg/dl, lactic acid 3.4 mmol/l.\nThe fundoscopic examination revealed hypertensive retinopathy without papilledema. A non contrast brain computed tomography revealed bilateral symmetrical white matter hypodensity in the parietal, temporal, and occipital regions suggesting PRES []. No other abnormalities were noted. There was no history of cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy or eclampsia. Laboratory investigations revealed hemoglobin, 9.2 gm/L; total white cell count, 5.65 × 103/μl (differential count: 55% neutrophils, 42% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils); platelet count, 1.5 × 105/μl; serum creatinine (SCr), 7.2 mg/dl; blood urea, 92 mg/dL; serum calcium, 8.7 mg/dl; serum phosphorus, 5.7 mg/dl; serum magnesium, 2 mg/l; alanine aminotransferase, 34 units/l (normal range: 0-40 units/l); aspartate aminotransferase, 30 units/l (normal range: 5-34 units/l); serum bilirubin, 1 mg/dl; and serum albumin, 3.8 gm/dl. Multiple blood, urine, and sputum cultures were sterile. With control of hypertension, the patient improved dramatically.\nIntravenous lorazepam was given for acute control of seizures and she went on to require phenytoin, valproic acid and levetiracetam. She was started on more frequent HD. She required five different types of antihypertensive drugs to control blood pressure. Initially she was started on intravenous nitroprusside and nytroglycerine to rapidly control blood pressure. Cardiac monitoring, frequent measurement of blood pressure, and pulse oximetry were instituted. She recovered clinically within one week. The resolution of findings on neuroimaging occurred gradually. Subsequently, she underwent successful LD RTx without recurrence of PRES.\n\nUsing the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nMDRD GFR Equation: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient, where race_coefficient is 1.212 for black patients and 1.0 for non-black parients, and gender_coefficient is 1 for men and 0.742 for women",

His past renal history included end-stage renal disease from unclear etiology, a living-related renal transplant that he rejected within a week, a deceased donor renal transplant a year later, and hypertension. His other medical issues included hyperlipidemia, gout, and hypothyroidism. His treatment two weeks prior for his cellular and humoral rejection consisted of Methylprednisone 500 mg intravenous (IV) × 3 doses, plasmapheresis × 4 treatments, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 1 gram per kilogram per day × 2 doses, Rituximab 375 mg/m2 × 1 dose, and Thymoglobulin 1.5 mg/kg × 5 doses.\nOn presentation, he reported arthralgias which started in the right knee and were subsequently followed by arthralgias in the left shoulder and left wrist. He had a fever of 101.1°F (38.4°C), his left wrist was swollen on exam, and his right knee was tender with an effusion. The rest of the vitals and physical exam were unremarkable. Laboratory studies showed white cell count (WBC) of 7.9 × 10 E3, hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl, hematocrit 29%, platelets 157 × 10 E3, sodium 136 meq/l, potassium 4.2 meq/l, chloride 105 meq/l, carbon dioxide 21 meq/l, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 41 mg/dl, serum creatinine (Scr) 1.8 mg/dl (baseline 1.7 mg/dl), total protein 6.7 g/dl, albumin 2.2 g/dl, AST 27 Unit/L, ALT 71 Unit/L, creatinine kinase 119 Unit/L, and uric acid 5 mg/dl. His wrist X-rays did not show any abnormalities, whereas his knee X-rays indicated a mild joint effusion of the right knee. Joint aspiration of the right knee showed total nucleated cells of 830 with neutrophils 62%, lymphocytes 0%, monocytes 38%, and no crystals were seen by polarized microscopy.\nGiven his hemodynamic stability, he was not started on empiric antibiotics; however, extensive workup was sent to rule out bacterial and viral infections. All of the evaluated viral serologies were negative and included Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), BK Virus (BKV), and Parvovirus B19 (). Rheumatologic workup showed low complement C3 and C4, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ().\nIn light of his recent treatment with Thymoglobulin and Rituximab, presenting symptoms, and negative infectious workup (), a presumptive diagnosis of serum sickness was made. His serum sickness was thought most likely secondary to Thymoglobulin but Rituximab was also high on differential, as delineated further in this paper. Heterologous antibodies were noted to be positive against rabbit IgG and IgM, low positive against horse IgG, and negative for mouse IgG (). Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and corticosteroids are treatment options for Thymoglobulin-associated serum sickness; however, serum sickness from Rituximab has only been shown to be treated with corticosteroids. Given uncertain cause of his serum sickness, we started our patient on high dose Methylprednisone 500 milligrams IV per day for three days. He had complete resolution of polyarthralgia and swelling after the third dose of Methylprednisone.\nDuring his hospitalization and treatment for his serum sickness, he developed acute kidney injury (AKI). A day after his third dose of Methylprednisone, his Scr peaked at 2.8 mg/dl from an initial baseline of 1.7 mg /dl (). His urinalysis was negative for infection, and urine microscopy showed granular and muddy brown casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Thus, his dose of furosemide was decreased to 20 milligrams from 40 milligram by mouth twice a day, and he was encouraged to drink more fluids. His renal function began improving on day no. 2 after-treatment with Methylprednisone, and Scr retuned back to his baseline of 1.7 mg/dl on day no. 6 after-treatment with Methylprednisone.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Delta Ratio: albumin_corrected_delta_ratio = albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

The post-operative course was unremarkable with excellent graft function and serum creatinine ranging from 1.4 to 1.7 mg/dL for many years. Immunosuppression was maintained with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone. There were no episodes of rejection or recurrent urinary tract infection. Seven years later, serum creatinine was noted to increase to as high as 3.6 mg/dL over a few days from presentation. There were neither specific complaints nor any localizing physical examination findings. A kidney ultrasound showed a hyperechoic solid mass in the renal medulla, with central compression and resultant hydronephrosis. Follow-up imaging with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed an 11 × 10 × 8.5 cm fatty mass at the center of the transplant kidney, causing compression of the central renal pelvis and dilatation of peripheral calyces (). Mycophenolate mofetil was held for initial suspicion of malignancy and was then restarted once malignancy was ruled out after the medullary mass biopsy.\nDue to the obstruction and renal deterioration, a percutaneous nephrostomy was placed with subsequent nephrostogram showing dilatation and distortion of the renal allograft collecting system. After decompression, the patient had an improvement in renal function with serum creatinine decreasing to 1.6 mg/dL ().\nA biopsy of both the renal cortex and medullary mass was performed. Renal cortex biopsy showed low-range borderline acute tubulointerstitial rejection with mononuclear infiltrates, extensive arteriolar hyalinosis and moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. There was no evidence of polyoma virus nephropathy. A biopsy of the renal medullary mass revealed mature adipocytes with no evidence of hyperchromasia and increased vascularity ().

The symptoms started insidiously and progressed to a point where his exercise tolerance was reduced to a few steps. He was a plumber by profession and a lifetime nonsmoker. He denied wheezing, fever, night sweats, chest pain, and weight loss. He had no history of hemoptysis or bleeding from any other body sites. He did not use any medications and denied recent travel or sick contacts. On physical examination, he appeared to be in moderate respiratory distress, tachycardia, and tachypnea. His vital signs were blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg, heart rate of 116/min, respiratory rate of 34/min, temperature of 99.1 F, and saturating at 96% on 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. He was oriented to time place and person and was found to be using his accessory muscles of respiration. His chest examination was notable for coarse crackles on the right side without any wheezing. His cardiac examination revealed tachycardia with a 3/6 pansystolic murmur best heard over the mitral area. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable. His extremities were perfusing well and no peripheral edema was noted. His labs were notable for leukocytosis with neutrophilia (WBC: 12.7 k/mm3; neutrophils: 84%; eosinophils < 1%), his electrolytes were within normal range, and renal function was deranged with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Na: 143 mEq/L; K: 4.6 mEq/L; Cl: 107 mEq/L; HCO3: 23 mEq/L; BUN: 40 mg/dL; creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL). His liver function tests (LFTs) were notable for elevated liver enzymes (AST: 48 U/L; ALT: 127 U/L). His arterial blood gas (ABG) was notable for a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and a pO2 of 84 mmHg. His chest X-ray (CXR) showed right sided fluffy infiltrates (). He was admitted to the medical floor and started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed community acquired pneumonia. However, his respiratory status deteriorated and he was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit where he was started on noninvasive mechanical ventilation (inspiratory pressure of 15 mmHg, expiratory pressure of 8 mmHg at 100% oxygen supplementation). An ABG showed a pH of 7.13, pCO2 of 64 mmHg, and a pO2 of 68 mmHg indicative of acute respiratory acidosis. His respiratory condition continued to deteriorate and he was intubated and mechanically ventilated with a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 mmHg and 50% oxygen supplementation. The patient's CXR revealed infiltrates which were more dense and confluent (). His labs were significant for up-trending leukocytosis (15 k/mm3). The patient's blood and urine cultures were negative. Tests for legionella, mycoplasma, HIV, and influenza were also negative. Autoimmune and vasculitis panels [antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody (GBM)] tests were negative. An ABG after commencing mechanical ventilation showed a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and a pO2 of 81 mmHg. Computed tomography (CT) of his chest confirmed the presence of dense infiltrates predominantly located in the right upper and middle lobes (Figures and ). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 70%, mildly dilated left atrium, significant prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/35 mmHg (systolic/diastolic/mean); pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 22 mmHg, right atrial pressure of 4 mmHg, RV: 53/6 mmHg (systolic/diastolic); cardiac Index (by thermo dilution) of 2.1 liters/min/m2, and a pulmonary artery resistance of 9 wood units. Bronchoscopy revealed fresh blood in all the lobes with no obvious source and no endobronchial lesions. Sequential lavage from the right middle lobe was not progressively bloodier and hence less consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for cytology, acid fast bacillus (AFB), fungal stain, and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Thoracentesis yielded 150 cc of serous fluid with a pH of 7.6, LDH of 80 U/L, protein of 0.9 g/dL, glucose of 120 mg/dL, cell count with a differential of 55% of neutrophils, lymphocytes of 25%, and mesothelial cells of 10%. This was consistent with a transudative pleural effusion. The cytology and culture results of the fluid from thoracentesis were also negative. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed thickening and elongation of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve consistent with myxomatous degeneration, up to 1 cm in thickness at the margin of the anterior leaflet, prolapse of posterior leaflet into left atrium, aneurysm measuring 1 × 1.6 cm2 and perforation into left atrium and severe mitral regurgitation but no vegetations. The patient continued to have increased oxygen requirements and persistent hemoptysis and eventually underwent an emergent mitral valve repair. Perioperative TEE revealed hypertrophied right and left ventricles, normal right and left ventricular function with EF of 55%, mild anteroseptal wall hypokinesis, prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet with a flail P3 segment, and severe mitral regurgitation with systolic flow reversal in right upper pulmonary vein (Figures and ). A final diagnosis of alveolar hemorrhage secondary to severe acute mitral regurgitation from myxomatous degeneration of mitral valve was made. Notably, his hemoglobin had decreased from 14.5 gm/dL to 11.7 gm/dL. Postoperative TEE did not show any evidence of mitral valve regurgitation (). A repeat bronchoscopy 3 days after the mitral valve repair showed clearing of the alveolar hemorrhage (Figures , , and ).

He initially received his DDKT in 2010, which has been complicated by multiple episodes of both acute T cell-mediated and acute antibody-mediated rejection. The patient admitted to a two-month history of immunosuppressive medication nonadherence with tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone.\nPhysical examination revealed a young male, in no distress, weighing 142 pounds. He had a blood pressure of 153/102 mmHg and a heart rate of 77 beats/min. Exam findings are as follows: pale conjunctiva, lungs clear to auscultation, regular heart rate and rhythm, active bowel sounds, no abdominal tenderness, and no focal neurological deficit. Admission labs included a serum creatinine of 64.6 mg/dL (0.67–1.17 mg/dL) with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 212 mg/dL (6–20 mg/dL), which increased to a serum creatinine of 73.8 mg/dL and BUN of 244 mg/dL prior to initiation of emergent dialysis.

Dialysis was complicated by new onset of seizures, initially thought to be secondary to dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed showing right temporal spikes epileptiform discharges with intermittent slow waves lateralized to the right hemisphere. Patient was thought to have epilepsy with initial seizure exacerbation secondary to severe metabolic derangements in setting of acute renal failure and severe azotemia. He was initiated on daily levetiracetam with resolution of seizures.\nPatient received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) while in the intensive care unit.

She reported no autoimmune disease, was not pregnant or in the early post-partum period, nor did she take an oral contraceptive pill or report any history of drug abuse. She was also not menstruating at time of admission. Risk factors for coronary artery disease were not found. At presentation, her blood pressure was 116/70 mm Hg and her heart rate was 75 beats/min. Her physical examination results were within normal limits without murmurs, rubs or gallops. There were no manifestations of connective tissue disease and the hematologic, renal parameters were normal. The initial electrocardiogram showed nonspecific T wave inversion in leads III, aVF () and the initial chest X-ray was normal without cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema. Cardiac enzymes were elevated with initial serum troponin T of 0.07 mcg/L (normal <0.014 mcg/L), creatinine kinase (CK) of 138 U/L (normal <215 U/L) and CK-MB of 8.49 mcg/L (normal <3.77 mcg/L).

Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular systolic function, with an ejection fraction of 73% and no regional wall motion abnormalities. We performed coronary angiography under suspicion of myocardial infarction. The right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery images were normal, but there was diffuse stenotic lesion of the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) with up to 80% luminal narrowing. The lesion slightly improved after intracoronary injection of nitroglycerine (). To evaluate the etiology of the stenotic lesion, in terms of spasm, atherosclerosis or other cause, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS, Boston scientific Co., CA, USA) was performed. IVUS showed an isolated dissection flap composed of all of the intima and media, including the internal elastic lamina and external elastic lamina, compressed by hematoma in the false lumen at the bifurcation edge of the mid LAD and diagonal branch. The dissection entry tear site to the false lumen was not detected on angiogram. Furthermore, this site was not clearly detected even on IVUS, and there was no communication between the false and true lumen (). Atherosclerotic change was not detected in this vessel (LAD) on the IVUS. 3.0×28 and 2.5×23 mm sized two Xience Prime stents (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were deployed over the dissection from the distal portion of the mid LAD for preventing any subsequent propagation of the dissection. Subsequent angiography revealed no residual stenosis without secondary dissection and restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow (). Subsequent IVUS demonstrated a fully covered dissection lesion ().\nThe patient had a favorable clinical course and was discharged on aspirin, clopidogrel, beta blocker and statin.

The patient had lost nearly 12 kilograms in the past 6 months. Abdominal pain was localized in the right upper quadrant. She had obtuse pain that had no relation to food. It was found that the patient had osteoporosis in her history but did not receive any treatment. In the physical examination of the patient, who did not present any characteristics in her family history, the liver extended to 2 cm below the costal margin. She did not have ascites or splenomegaly. Heart and lung examinations were normal. Laboratory tests presented a normal hemogram. Biochemical tests revealed an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 50 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 20 U/L, total bilirubin level of 1.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 101 U/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase level of 227 U/L, albumin level of 2.6 g/dL, total protein level of 4.9 g/dL, calcium level of 12,35 mg/dL, and a phosphate level of 2.6 mg/dL. The patient was hospitalized in order to investigate the etiology of hypercalcemia. The patient had a parathormone level of 9.5 pg/mL. These results excluded a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient who was thought to have malignant hypercalcemia was started on intravenous fluid replacement and furosemide treatment. The patient who manifested a creatinine clearance of 55.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 was started on 2 mg zoledronic acid treatment. Tomography scans demonstrated no osteolytic bone lesions. During follow-up, the patient's calcium levels regressed to 9.7 mg/dL with the specified treatment. Abdominal ultrasonography performed due to right upper quadrant pain and hepatomegaly revealed multiple hypoechoic images in the liver, of which the largest was 1.5 cm in size, and a coarsely granular parenchyma. The dynamic CT of the patient demonstrated hypodense lesions with multiple areas of peripheral contrast enhancement that were particularly congregated in the right lobe, the largest of which had a size of 47 × 32 mm, and this was interpreted as metastasis (Figure ).\nLevels of alpha-fetoprotein were determined as 91 ng/mL, cancer antigen (CA-125) as 258.6 U/mL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as 0.82 ng/mL, and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) as 2.1 U/mL. A biopsy was performed on the mass in the liver for diagnosis. Pathology result indicated cholangiocellular cancer (Figure ). The patient did not consent to surgical resection; therefore, a monthly zoledronic acid treatment was planned for pain palpation and hypercalcemia.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

He had a positive family history of type 1 diabetes from his mother. During physical examination, he was alert, afebrile, with blood pressure of 126/84 mmHg, pulse rate of 107, respiratory rate 18, with dry mucous membranes and reduced skin turgor.\nHis lab tests were notable for plasma glucose 479 mg/dL with large amounts of serum and urine ketones, pH 7.15, anion gap 36, lactic acid 2.7 mmol/L, calculated serum osmolality 288 mOsm/L, serum sodium 129 mEq/L, potassium 3.2 mEq/L, bicarbonate 9 mmol/L, chloride 84 mEq/L, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, phosphorous 2.6 mg/dL, magnesium 1.3 mg/dL, HbA1C 14.4%, urine glucose > 1000 mg/dL and urine toxicology negative. Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia and prolonged QT interval (Figure ). He was diagnosed with DKA and was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nIntravenous insulin was started after magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus replacement. Intravenous insulin was stopped, or dosage reduced several times due to the severity of hypokalemia. A total of 400-450 mEq per day of potassium chloride was administered intravenously and orally during the first three days. Also, total magnesium sulfate 6-8 g was given daily for three days. In the first four days, his daily urine output ranged from 5.5 to 6.5 L. This was repleted with oral and intravenous fluids. Hyperglycemia, ketonemia and anion gap metabolic acidosis resolved after four days.\nOn day 5, his clinical condition improved, and acidosis resolved. His biochemical tests showed metabolic alkalosis with bicarbonate level of 38 mmol/L, and the patient remained alkalotic without any signs of dehydration. He had no vomiting and did not receive sodium bicarbonate or diuretics throughout hospitalization. He was not on any other medications.\nFurthermore, despite aggressive repletion of potassium and magnesium, the patient remained hypokalemic and hypomagnesemic. He required 40-80 mEq of potassium chloride and 1 g of oral magnesium daily after acidosis and polyuria resolved to bring the serum potassium and magnesium concentrations to the normal level.\nOn day 8, while the patient was being discharged from the hospital, his urinary electrolytes and serum electrolytes were checked. The lab results showed potassium 4.5 mEq/L, magnesium 1.5 mg/dL, calcium 9.2 mg/dL, bicarbonate 33 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dL. The urine random studies revealed sodium 32 mEq/L, chloride 54 mEq/L, potassium 79 mEq/L, magnesium 8.5 mg/dL, calcium 6.5 mg/dL, phosphorus 48.8 mg/dL and creatinine 60.3 mg/dL.\nIn this case, the management of ketoacidosis required high doses of intravenous potassium chloride to obtain normal serum potassium levels. After the management of DKA, the patient showed continued hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia with a new metabolic alkalosis while urine chloride was more than 40 mEq/L.\nHe was discharged with Levemir® insulin, lispro insulin, oral magnesium gluconate and potassium chloride. He was also advised to go to the nephrology clinic for follow-up.\nSeven weeks after discharge, his repeated random urine study revealed sodium 69 mEq/L, chloride 125 mEq/L, potassium 79 mEq/L, magnesium 13.8 mg/dL, calcium 3.5 mg/dL, phosphorus 23.8 mg/dL and creatinine 162 mg/dL.

            "input": "A 71-year-old man, non-smoker (height: 155 cm; weight: 59 kg), was scheduled to receive video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy with the diagnosis of MG. Two months previously, he developed symptoms of right ptosis and progressive swallowing difficulty. Based on a positive response to edrophonium and increased titers of autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptor (19.3 nmol/L; normal < 0.2 nmol/L), he was diagnosed as having MG with severity belonging to Osserman's classification IIb (ie, generalized moderate weakness and/or bulbar dysfunction). Thoracic computed tomography demonstrated glandular hyperplasia of the thymus (Fig. A). The patient was started on prednisolone 20 mg daily and pyridostigmine 60 mg three times daily. His past history included hypertension without evidence of previous myasthenic crisis or thromboembolic events (eg, history of lower limb swelling). The results of electrocardiography, pulmonary function test [eg, vital capacity: 93%], echocardiography (eg, left ventricular ejection fraction: 85.1%), chest radiography (Fig. B), and laboratory studies (eg, coagulation test) were unremarkable. On the other hand, impaired renal function [i.e., serum creatinine: 1.42 mg/dL; eGFR: 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2] was observed after admission.\nPreoperative physical examination of the patient showed clear consciousness without respiratory distress. Vital signs included a blood pressure of 187/103 mm Hg, heart rate of 82 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/minute. Under real-time neuromuscular monitoring with a train-of-four (TOF) monitor (TOF-watch SX, N.V. Organon, Oss, Netherlands), anesthesia was induced with propofol (130 mg) and rocuronium (0.85 mg/kg). Following successful tracheal intubation with a double-lumen tracheal tube (Broncho-Cath; Mallinckrodt, Athlone, Ireland), general anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, rocuronium (total dosage: 40 mg), and a continuous infusion of remifentanil. An 18-gauge peripheral intravenous line and an arterial line were introduced. The surgical time was 4 hours 15 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 100 mL. Upon completion of surgery, sugammadex 4 mg/kg was administered to reverse neuromuscular blockade, with a maximum TOF ratio of 0.93 following reversal. Additionally, intravenous morphine 8 mg was given for postoperative analgesia. After successful extubation in the operating room and resumption of spontaneous breathing, he was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for further care.\nDuring the immediate postoperative period, the patient was hemodynamically stable without respiratory distress. Because of surgical pain with a numeric rating scale of 5 (scale of 0–10), intravenous morphine was titrated to a total dosage of 7 mg. Forty-five minutes later, respiratory distress with drowsiness was noted. Physical examination found pinpoint pupils with a TOF ratio of 0.9. Blood gas analysis demonstrated severe hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide pressure: 117.7 mm Hg) and acidosis (pH: 6.996, lactate levels: 3.3 mmol/L). On suspicion of morphine overdose, intravenous naloxone was administered twice (0.08 mg each time). After 20 minutes, the patient regained consciousness and normal respiratory pattern. Subsequent blood gas analysis demonstrated hyperlactatemia (lactate levels: 6.0 mmol/L) (Fig. ) despite improvement in arterial carbon dioxide pressure and arterial oxygen pressure after naloxone administration. Taking into account the overall clinical improvement, he was transferred to ward with spontaneous breathing and stable hemodynamics after observation for 100 minutes following initial reversal of opioid overdose.\nHowever, one hour after being transferred to ward (ie, three hours after naloxone administration), he was found to exhibit consciousness loss, respiratory distress, and pinpoint pupils. Intravenous naloxone 0.4 mg was given, followed by endotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilatory support. Brain computed tomography showed no intracranial lesion. He regained consciousness two hours after naloxone administration in the intensive care unit without symptoms of opioid withdrawal (eg, pulmonary edema). As weaning from mechanical ventilation was difficult on POD 3, a diagnosis of POMC was made. Steroid therapy (prednisolone 40 mg twice daily) and pyridostigmine (60 mg 3 times a day) was initiated. The patient was extubated smoothly on POD 6 and was discharged from hospital on POD 12. The course of hyperlactatemia was shown in Figure . In addition, his eGFR increased from 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline to 88.9 ml/min/1.73m2 on POD 5. Pathological analysis of the specimen from thymectomy confirmed the diagnosis of type B2 thymoma according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.\nThe patient was readmitted on POD 24 because of left thigh swelling. Ultrasonographic examination showed evidence of DVT involving the left femoral and popliteal veins. Anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (ie, subcutaneous Clexane 60 mg every 12 hours) was implemented immediately after hospitalization, and he was discharged without sequelae on POD 31. During hospitalization, his eGFR was 86.5 mL/min/1.73m2. There was no recurrence of myasthenic crisis or DVT up to 3 months of follow-ups.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

The patient has a history of decompensated hepatic cirrhosis that started 1 year ago complicated by ascites and a large umbilical hernia. The patient has had multiple paracentesis and had several episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. His medication list included tramadol and propranolol. Upon admission to the emergency department, he was found to be severely malnourished with significant loss of muscle mass, abdominal distention, and the presence of a large, tender, compressible umbilical hernia. Physical exam showed flank dullness, a fluid wave, and shifting dullness. Vital signs were normal, and he did not show signs of asterixis, hepatic encephalopathy, edema, or fluid overload elsewhere. His white blood cell (WBC) count was high at 10,270/µL and hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 32.6%, and a platelet count of 130,000/µL. Further testing showed hyponatremia at 133 mmol/L and a total bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL. Liver function test revealed an albumin of 2.9 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 149 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 64 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 36 U/L. X-ray confirmed large-volume ascites and the presence of a ventral hernia. Abdominal ultrasound showed cirrhotic liver morphology with large-volume ascites and splenomegaly. Ascitic fluid was yellow, and analysis showed WBC count of 70/µL, but was otherwise unremarkable. After being admitted to the hospital, patient was given furosemide 40 mg tablet daily and spironolactone 100 mg tablet daily. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management. Surgical consultation was sought, and since the patient was a very high-risk surgical candidate with loss of muscle mass, surgical intervention was not planned. The patient chose supportive care and prophylactic antibiotics based on infectious disease recommendations. An ostomy pouch was placed over the hernia to prevent bacterial contamination and peritonitis as well as to collect the ascitic fluid. The patient’s severe abdominal pain subsided and was discharged to follow up with his primary care physician.\nThree months after the patient was discharged, he came back to the hospital with worsening symptoms because he could not afford the ostomy pouches. He was not compliant with his follow-ups. His umbilical hernia appeared to have worsened, and ascitic fluid was leaking out from multiple areas on his hernia, and there were also multiple areas of skin necrosis. Since the patient was deemed a high-risk surgical candidate, he was, again, not cleared for surgery.

She was unconscious, febrile, with a blood pressure of 80/40 mmHg, pulse rate of 160/min, and a respiratory rate of 34/min. Physical examination revealed a diffuse tenderness and a muscular rigidity. The abdomen was distended and bowel sounds were absent. The abdominal X-ray obtained in a supine position showed a massive free air within the peritoneal cavity and undigested remains of food along the alimentary tract imitating the contrasting liquid (). At hospital admission, a medical audit accompanying the girl described a 4-days history of food rejection, frequent vomiting and progressive deterioration of her general condition. Her anamnesis was negative for traumatic events but was suggestive for PA due to a characteristic appearance of air swelling and abdominal distension that rapidly progressed during the day and caused the flatus during sleep.\nLaboratory investigations revealed the following results: White blood cell count: 7.100/uL; mean platelet volume: 11.8 fL; platelet count: 220 × 103/uL; hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dL; hematocrit: 35.2%; serum proteins: 5.7 g/dL; serum albumin: 2.9 g/dL; serum globulin: 2.8 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase: 107 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase: 30 IU/l; creatinine: 0.9 mg/dl; serum sodium: 135 mEq/L; serum potassium: 5.4 mEq/L; serum chloride: 101 mEq/L; C-reactive protein: 367.4 mg/L; serum lactate dehydrogenase: 401 IU/L; serum creatine kinase: 4,086 IU/L; serum glucose: 107 mg/dL; arterial blood pH: 7.07 nmol/L; PaCO2: 4.93 kPa; pO2: 5.59 kPa; HCO3: 10.5 mmol/L; base excess: 18.8 mEq/L.\nFollowing an aggressive resuscitation with intravenous hydration, decompression of the stomach, a correction of metabolic abnormalities, and administration of empiric antibiotic therapy (amikacin, metronidazole, and meropenem), an emergency laparotomy was performed. It revealed a massively distended and partially necrotic stomach. Huge amounts of free peritoneal fluid (about four liters) with food particles due to perforation of the necrotic gastric wall were removed. The size of the perforation measured 7 × 3 cm affecting the greater curvature on the posterior wall of the stomach ().\nA free peritoneal fluid with food particles was washed out from the abdominal cavity. The gastric perforation was treated by debridement of necrotic tissue and a primary closure with additional using an omental patch. The debrided necrotic gastric tissue was submitted to the pathologist for the examination. The pathology assessment of the gastric wall showed a multiple areas of massive, transmural necrosis ().\nPost-operatively, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) on mechanical ventilation and treated with inotropes, cefotaxime, metronidazole, gentamicin, and fluconazole. A fourth day of admission, abdominal cultures taken at the laparotomy as well as a blood culture showed Enterococcus faecalis and Candida glabrata infections.\nIn the following days, despite an extensive medical support, her clinical condition rapidly deteriorated and she eventually died on day 26 after admission due to overwhelming infections and progressive multisystem failure.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Anion Gap: albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL))",

There was no past medical history and she was not taking any regular medication. On examination she was of normal body weight (weight 53 kg and body mass index 21 kg/m2), afebrile and her blood pressure was 103/56 with no postural change measured. Although she appeared drowsy and unwell, her systemic examination was unremarkable and no focal abnormalities were found on neurological examination of the central or peripheral nervous system. Initial biochemical analysis revealed sodium 127 mmol/l, potassium 3.2 mmol/l, urea 3.8 mmol/l, creatinine 77 and glucose 4.1 mmol/l. Inflammatory markers (white cell count and C-reactive protein) were normal. A computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) of the brain demonstrated normal ventricles, no focal lesion or mass effect and normal sagittal sinus flow. Upon lumbar puncture, performed in the lateral decubitus position, an opening pressure of 40 mm of water was documented. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microscopy revealed two white blood cells (WBCs) per mm3, <1 red blood cell (RBC) per mm3 and no organisms. CSF chemistry was unremarkable: protein 0.4 g/l and glucose 3.2 mmol/l. The patient had remained drowsy and she was managed in the Intensive Care Unit with a presumptive diagnosis of acute meningoencephalitis with a secondary syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH). No measurements of serum or urine osmolality were made. She was treated with antibiotics and acyclovir and was also supported with intravenous fluids and, within 24 hours, had improved such that she was transferred back to the ward.\nDuring subsequent review she admitted to several months of generalised fatigue, sometimes falling asleep at work, and of intermittent headaches. With subsequent neurology specialist input to review the grossly elevated intracranial pressure, accompanied by normal imaging and CSF analysis, the patient was commenced on acetazolamide 250 mg daily for presumed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Visual acuity and visual field (Goldman perimetry) testing was unremarkable. On endocrine review, generalised hyperpigmentation with facial melasma were noted and, although she had no buccal pigmentation, she did have marked pigmentation of a recent scar over her left shoulder (Figure ). A short synacthen (250 mcg) test (SST) was performed and demonstrated adrenal insufficiency with basal cortisol at 231 nmol/l, 30 minute cortisol 265 nmol/l and 60 minute at 200 nmol/l. A repeat SST showed basal cortisol at 138 nmol/l and 30 minute cortisol at 159 nmol/l and confirmed adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal antibodies were negative. Her plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was raised at >278 pmol/l consistent with primary adrenal failure. She was commenced on glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone 10 mg bd) and mineralocorticoid (fludrocortisone 50 mcg) replacement therapy and discharged. On subsequent review two weeks later, she was feeling much better with CSF pressure reduced to 25 mm of water on repeat lumbar puncture. Acetazolamide was discontinued after three months and on subsequent reviews at six and 12 months, she continued to remain well on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone replacement.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

            "input": "Our patient was a 47-year-old man who was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot 3 months after birth. He had a Waterston operation at 9 months of age and a Blalock–Taussig procedure at 1 year, 10 months of age. At age 10, the patient underwent surgery to ligate the ascending aorta–right pulmonary artery shunt path. He did not undergo intracardiac repair. The main pulmonary artery was completely occluded from the right ventricular outflow tract. The right-to-left shunted blood ejected from the left ventricle through the ventricular septal defect and merged with oxygenated blood via the shunt path from the left subclavian artery to the left pulmonary artery.\nRenal function decreased when the patient was 38 years of age. Home oxygen therapy at night was initiated 1 year before the patient presented at our hospital; a β-blocker (carvedilol, 2.5 mg/day) was started 6 months before presentation. The patient did not experience breathing difficulty in his daily life (New York Heart Association Class II) and was able to work. A PD catheter was inserted in April 2015. Renal function gradually decreased and exacerbation of lower leg edema was observed, so PD was started. The patient’s height was 158 cm, his weight was 54 kg, his body temperature was 36.3 °C, his blood pressure was 136/69 mmHg, his pulse rate was 81 beats/min, and his oxygen saturation was 81% in room air.\nLaboratory testing was performed on admission. Urinalysis dipstick examination indicated 4+ protein (8 g/g Cr) and was negative for blood. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.278, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, PaO2 of 52 mmHg, bicarbonate of 19.7 mmol/L, and base excess of − 6.9 mmol/L. Chest X-ray showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 63%, indicating cardiac enlargement. Abdominal ultrasonography showed mild atrophy of the bilateral kidneys, increased cortical brightness, and cysts. Left ventricular findings of cardiac ultrasonography included a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of 44 mm, left ventricular end-systolic diameter of 28 mm, left ventricular ejection fraction of 71%, septal thickness of 26 mm, and rear wall thickness of 11 mm. The valve findings were mild aortic regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary artery closure. The main pulmonary artery was not visible from the right ventricular outflow tract. The ventricular septal defect was 19–22 mm in diameter; there was almost right-to-left shunting across the defect, with only a slight left-to-right shunt. After Waterston operation there was good flow through the shunt from the ascending aorta to the right pulmonary artery. After left Blalock–Taussig shunt operation there was decreased flow velocity from the left subclavian artery to the left pulmonary artery.\nIn July 2015, PD was started. Serum creatinine (Cr) at the start of PD was 5.5 mg/dl. The fast peritoneal equilibrium test (PET) result was low average. From November 2015 (4 months after the start of PD), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) gradually increased, water removal was 200–300 mL/day, and body weight increased. In March 2016 (8 months after starting PD), the PD fluid protocol was changed. In February 2017, the patient developed lower leg edema and his BNP increased to 1300 pg/mL, so treatment was changed to continuous cycling PD. With increased water removal, the edema resolved and BNP rapidly decreased. Changes associated with cyanosis included a hemoglobin level of 18–20 g/dL, indicating polycythemia; the patient also experienced headache. Phlebotomy treatment was performed four times. Because of concerns about iron deficiency resulting from phlebotomy, hemostasis therapy was discontinued, after which the patient’s headache improved (Fig. ).\nThe serum bicarbonate level at the start of PD in July 2015 was 20 mmol/L. This value increased to 25–30 mmol/L with the change in PD fluid protocol, and venous blood PCO2 increased with the start of PD (Fig. ).\nThe target SpO2 was adjusted to 70–85%; SpO2 was unchanged after PD. SpO2 decreased with the complication of heart failure, but improved with fluid management. Periodic echocardiography showed that PD initiation had little effect on hemodynamics.\nThere were no PD-related complications.\nIn July 2019, 5 years after the start of dialysis, the patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of abdominal pain and dyspnea. Abdominal CT revealed a diverticulum of the colon in the hepatic curvature of the transverse colon. Surgery was considered to carry a high risk of respiratory and hemodynamic breakdown in this patient. On the basis of abdominal findings and CT findings, it was concluded that conservative treatment with antibiotics and fasting was appropriate. With the consent of the family, laparotomy was not performed and conservative treatment was initiated. Streptococcus salivarius was subsequently detected in culture of the PD effluent and MRSA was detected in blood culture. Antibiotic treatment based on sensitivity testing was started and the peritoneal catheter was removed, but there was no improvement. The patient developed septic shock and died 27 days after admission.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?\n\nIdeal Body Weight: IBW = base_weight + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60), where base_weight is 50 kg for men and 45.5 kg for women",

            "input": "The present case report was published with the prior consent of the patient’s guardians.\nA 23-year-old, 168 cm tall female patient, weighing 42 kg, visited the emergency room with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, kept increasing gradually for eight hours. The patient was diagnosed with major depression and bulimia nervosa nine years ago. The patient also had a history of frequent vomiting after episodes of binge eating, along with numerous suicide attempts. Ten hours before reporting to the hospital, the patient ate a very large quantity food, equivalent to approximately ten portions; however, the quantity of the vomit was much less, relative to the amount of food taken. The physical examination revealed abdominal pain and distension in the entire region, along with tenderness, but no rebound tenderness. Subsequent abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed clear gastric distension. The results of various blood tests were normal. In the joint general surgery consultation that followed, it was decided that an immediate surgical treatment was not necessary; hence, the need for continuous observation of the condition was explained, and a gastroenterological or psychiatric hospitalization was advised, but both the patient and her guardians declined hospitalization. Afterward, they were warned of the possible complications, such as electrolyte imbalance, aspiration pneumonia, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic changes, due to the pressure applied by gastrointestinal distension, and the possibility of death, in case the condition worsened. The self-discharge form was signed, and they returned home.\nSeven hours after returning home, the patient re-visited the emergency room due to persistent abdominal pain, and mental confusion. At the time of the visit, the patient was unconscious. On physical examination, a more severe abdominal distension, and signs of abdominal rigidity were observed. Both legs of the patient had turned pale in color. No auscultation sounds were heard over the abdomen, and the dorsalis pedis pulse was not felt on either foot. Shock was suspected due to a 60/40 mmHg blood pressure, 160 beats/min heart rate, 22 times/minute aspiration rate, and 36.4℃ temperature. Other findings included pH 7.076, PaCO2 22.3 mmHg, PaO2 122 mmHg, HCO3- 6.3 mM/L, base excess (BE) 23.7 mM/L, and lactic acid 11.1 mM/L, which were measured in the arterial blood gas analysis and, thus, metabolic acidosis was confirmed. The electrolyte levels Na+ 157 mM/L, K+ 6.2 mM/L, and Cl- 130 mM/L, indicated that the electrolyte imbalance was severe (). In addition, the patient was in a severe hypoglycemic state with a blood sugar level of 15 mg/dl; because of an elevated creatinine level of 2.84 mg/dl, acute renal failure was suspected. First, to treat the metabolic acidosis, sodium bicarbonate was set at 80 mEq/h. In the abdominal X-ray, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was seen to be filled with a large amount of food but without any bowel gas (). Abdominal CT revealed a very large dilation of the stomach, esophagus, and the second part of the duodenum; it was suspected that the distended organs were pressing against the descending aorta, and the right kidney was pressed upwards (). One hour after the emergency room re-visit, the patient's mental state became lethargic—communication became impossible and spontaneous respiration decreased; as SpO2 was measured to be 88%, endotracheal intubation was performed. A Foley catheter was then inserted, but no urine was drained; an emergency hemodialysis was prepared, and for enough fluid supply, a central venous catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein. For continuous monitoring of changes in the vital signs, a conduit was placed in the right radial artery. An attempt was made to insert a nasogastric tube to relieve gastrointestinal pressure, but the food was not drained due to a blockage near the esophagus, which made further insertion impossible. An abdominal CT performed for follow-up observation revealed that the abdomen was still filled with food, and the nasogastric tube was twisted at the end of the esophagus (). It was also suspected that insertion was not possible due to gastroesophageal junction deviation or esophageal stenosis; however, no such sign was seen.\nThere was no decompression through the nasogastric tube, and as time passed, the mental state of the patient changed into a state of confusion. The patient’s vital signs became increasingly unstable. Since the symptoms and follow-up blood test results exacerbated, instead of performing a percutaneous drainage, it was decided to attempt a surgical decompression; subsequently, the patient was transferred to the operation room six hours after the re-visit. In the emergency room, a total of 3,170 ml of crystalloid fluid, in which a 5% glucose solution was included, was administered. Urine volume was not measured.\nAfter reaching the operation room, the patient’s blood pressure was 70/46 mmHg and the heart rate was 128 beats/min. First, in order to improve the vital signs, crystalloid fluid was administered at the highest speed via the right arm’s peripheral venous catheter and via the central venous catheter of the right internal jugular vein. The instillation of norepinephrine was initiated with sustained dosing at an additional rate of 0.2 μg/kg/min, and continuous infusion of vasopressin at 4–8 unit/h was also initiated. Subsequently, general anesthesia was induced using sevoflurane 1–2 vol% and rocuronium 50 mg. In the arterial blood gas analysis conducted after entering the operating room, pH 7.45, PaCO2 20.8 mmHg, PaO2 335 mmHg, Na+ 161 mM/L, K+ 3.8 mM/L, glucose 205 mg/dl, lactate 13 mM/L, hemoglobin 6.8 g/dl, and HCO3- 14.4 mM/L were measured (). Four units of erythrocytes were prescribed to correct the reduced hemoglobin, and 20 mg of furosemide was injected due to a continuous lack of urination. Furthermore, for rapid transfusion, the rapid infusion system (RIS) was connected to the central venous catheter of the right internal jugular vein, and the transfusion of four erythrocyte units was initiated.\nThe operating surgeon planned and performed a gastrotomy, after making a skin incision of approximately 10 cm and within 20 min of beginning the surgery. The food and 5,000 ml of body fluid present in the stomach were drained via suction. Thirty minutes after the operation, blood pressure was maintained low at 60/40 mmHg and almost all food was drained; as a large amount of continuous gastric bleeding occurred after decompression, a total of 6,000 ml was drained into the suction bottle. In the follow-up arterial blood gas analysis, results showed: pH 6.75, PaCO2 46 mmHg, and lactate 20 mM/L. Acidosis had worsened, the blood sugar level had significantly increased to 469 mg/dl, electrolyte imbalance had exacerbated with K+ 7.5 mM/L, and hemoglobin had fallen to 4.3 g/dl, suggesting a large amount of bleeding. To correct this, 60 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and two units of insulin were administered. Further, 1.2 g of calcium chloride was administered to treat hyperkalemia. Moreover, additional 20 μg of epinephrine was injected to correct persistent hypotension.\nBleeding in the stomach continued, and despite initiating erythrocyte transfusion via RIS, hemoglobin level decreased. As a result, a large amount of internal bleeding was suspected, and additional eight units of erythrocytes, and eight units of fresh frozen plasma were prescribed. The operating surgeon tried to determine the cause and area of bleeding, but as the surgical incision was only 10 cm, abdominal organs other than the stomach could not be identified with the naked eye. To reduce bleeding, the operating surgeon considered performing a total gastrectomy or extending the abdominal incision to confirm the bleeding areas from, other organs but concluded that the bleeding was due to ischemia-reperfusion injury after surgical decompression, and DIC. Since the patient’s vital signs steadily worsened, it was decided that the abdomen be closed urgently, and the patient moved to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nOne hour after the start of the operation, suturing after gastrectomy was completed. When the closing of the abdomen started, non-invasive blood pressure was not measured, and flat waveforms were observed in the catheter of the right radial artery. There was no pulse detected via palpation, and after confirming pulseless electrical activity through the observation of electrocardiogram, an additional 1 mg of epinephrine was injected, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated.\nA total of 3 mg of epinephrine was injected, with cardiac rhythm monitoring at 2 min intervals; afterward, 2 units of vasopressin were injected at 2 min intervals, totaling an injection of 4 units of vasopressin. After completing the abdominal closure while performing CPR, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, and no urine output was seen until the patient left the operation room.\nThe operation was conducted for 1 h 20 min, and the anesthesia time was 1 h 50 min. During the operation, a total of 800 ml, four erythrocyte units, were transfused, and 6,200 ml of crystalloid fluid were administered. A total of 6,000 ml was drained into the suction bottle—5,000 ml of food and body fluid through the suction unit via gastrectomy, and 1000 ml due to bleeding that had occurred after decompression from the start of the operation until finish; however, as mentioned earlier, the incision area was small, and bleeding occurring from other abdominal organs could not be confirmed, making it difficult to estimate the exact estimated blood loss. Additionally, prescribed erythrocytes and fresh frozen plasma were transfused through the RIS as the patient left the operation room.\nAfter entering the ICU, CPR was stopped due to a return of spontaneous circulation, but the existing usage of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin was preserved, and transfusion continued. However, blood pressure was still not measured, an additional 1,000 ml of bleeding was confirmed through the nasogastric tube, and bleeding from the closed abdominal area continued. Subsequently, as 3.5 g/dl hemoglobin was measured in the follow-up test, transfusion continued, and a 113.1-second prothrombin time, 180-s activated partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count of 22,000/μl were found, confirming that the patient was in a state of DIC. Despite continuous drug administration and transfusion, the hemoglobin level decreased to 1.8 g/dl, and after three hours in the ICU, the heartbeat disappeared, and the patient was declared dead.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta ratio?\n\nDelta Ratio: delta_ratio = delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

Due to positive family history (his brother had MMA), he underwent metabolic investigation. His metabolic evaluation revealed blood ammonia level of 400–500 mg/dL and elevated C3 carnitine level (48.8; reference range, < 4.1). The methylmalonic acid level in urine was 1617 µg/mg Cr, and elevation in plasma glycine (415 µmol/L) and alanine (978 µmol/L) levels were noted. Cobalamin (Cbl) incorporation study of 14C-propionate showed lack of response to Cbl (i.e. mut0) and slightly low response to adocobalamin (AdoCbl). Molecular investigations revealed a compound heterozygous c.1105C > T(p.R369C), p.G94Q mutation. He was fed with special formula (Propiomex), regular infant formula, low-protein food, and L-carnitine supplement (100 mg/kg/d). His developmental evaluation at 20 months of age showed a mild delay. Prior to 5 years of age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were in the normal range (BUN 6.6–12.3 mg/dL /creatinine 0.7–0.8 mg/dL). However, after 5.5 years of age, his renal function slowly deteriorated, showing a BUN level of 16.2–29.2 and creatinine level of 0.81–1.02. He was hospitalized multiple times due to metabolic decompensations (acidosis, dehydration, and hyperammonemia) after trivial infections or skipping of the special formula. At 6 years of age, his eye sight deteriorated progressively and he became legally blind due to optic atrophy by 10 years of age. He received growth hormone treatment for metabolic induction to anabolism and improvement of his short stature. At 15 years of age, he experienced vomiting and abdominal pain due to pancreatitis. His metabolic status became unstable; he was hospitalized more than 7 times with pancreatitis (Table ). At this time, he began to experience hand tremors due to his metabolic condition. After recurrent pancreatitis at 19 years of age, he showed glucose intolerance. By the age of 20 years, he developed DM, requiring insulin injection. His most recent metabolic crisis was accompanied by severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.8), liver dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 245 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 316 IU/L), hyperventilation, hemorrhagic gastritis, and left pleural effusion. His pancreatic amylase and lipase levels were > 4000 U/L. He was put on continuous renal replacement therapy for 3 days. During the metabolic crisis, he experienced seizures and hand tremors, although the results of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed necrotizing pancreatitis and follow-up ultrasound after 1 month of pancreatitis showed a pancreatic pseudocyst.

She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.\nOver the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.\nOn examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.\nPhysical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.\nContrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.\nHer laboratory studies were as shown in .\nSerum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.\nThe patient was started on intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) daily for one week, then weekly for one month. She was later lost to followup, and posttreatment evaluation of the skin hyperpigmentation and neurological evaluation could not be done.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?\n\nMean Arterial Pressure (MAP): MAP = 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure)",

He had a family history of type 2 diabetes and cancer (type not specified). He presented with left lumbar pain, dysuria, and hematuria that improved with antibiotic therapy, multiple analgesics, and spontaneous expulsion of a 0.5 × 0.5 cm calculus. During the urologic assessment, the renal ultrasound detected an incidental left adrenal tumor. In the next months, he developed leg cramps and early satiety and lost approximately 8 kg of body weight.\nLaboratory examinations reported serum sodium 138 mEq/L (normal 135–145 mEq/L), potassium 4.5 mEq/L (normal 3.5–5 mEq/L), calcium 11.1 mg/dL (normal 8.4–10.2 mg/dL), phosphate 2.5 mg/dL (normal 2.7–4.5 mg/dL), magnesium 1.7 mg/dL (normal 1.6–2.6 mg/dL), and albumin 4.2 g/dL (normal 3.4–4.8 g/dL). PTHi was also elevated (151 pg/mL, normal: 10–65 pg/mL) and vitamin D was normal (30 ng/mL). The screening for adrenal incidentaloma included urinary-free cortisol level of 104.61 mg/24 h (normal < 130 mg/24 h), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate of 150 µg/dL (normal: 95–530 µg/dL), plasmatic aldosterone concentration (PAC) of 24.9 ng/dL, plasmatic renin activity (PRA) of 0.207 ng/mL/h, PAC/PRA (aldosterone/renin ratio) of 124.5 (normal < 30), urinary normetanephrine of 377 µg/24 h (normal 82–500 µg/24 h), and urinary metanephrine <28 µg/24 h (normal 45–290 µg/24 h).\nAfter biochemical confirmation of hyperparathyroidism, a Tc99m-MIBI scintigraphy showed an abnormally increased tracer uptake in the right superior parathyroid (). The abdominal CT scan confirmed the presence of a giant left adrenal tumor (20 × 13 × 20 cm) (). Despite the kidney displacement due to the large tumor, there was no evidence of arterial stenosis. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism associated with an aldosterone-producing tumor (highly suspicious of malignancy) was made.\nBlood pressure was treated with spironolactone and ARA2. During surgery, enlargement of both left and right parathyroid glands was observed and bilateral parathyroidectomy was successfully done with pathological diagnosis of diffuse hyperplasia of both glands. After surgery, serum calcium decreased to 9 mg/dL, phosphate decreased to 2.7 mg/dL, magnesium decreased to 2 mg/dL, and PTHi decreased to 48.75 pg/mL. Blood pressure was successfully controlled with medical therapy and a left adrenalectomy was performed 5 months later. Histologic study reported a 2750 g tumor with diffuse architecture, areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, and venous invasion, three of the nine criteria previously described by Weiss for malignant adrenal neoplasias which is compatible with the final diagnosis of adrenal adenocarcinoma []. Immunohistochemical analysis reported positivity to inhibin alpha and Melan-A (MART-1) and neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin and negativity to PS100 and chromogranin A, which confirmed the diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor. Unfortunately, we have no access to the molecular (RT-PCR) or immunohistochemistry techniques that could allow us to identify the type 1 PTH receptor in tissue samples.\nAfter adrenalectomy, spironolactone was discontinued, blood pressure remained under control, and aldosterone levels were normal (6.1 ng/dL, normal < 10 ng/dL). Later, the patient had a generalized seizure and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a tumor in the right frontal area compatible with a metastatic lesion (). Afterwards, he presented with severe arm pain that did not respond well to analgesics. A muscular biopsy performed reported carcinoma metastases. Despite chemotherapy treatment, he died 9 months later.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.\n\nCalcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: calcium_level = (0.8 * (Normal Albumin (in g/dL) - Patient's Albumin (in g/dL))) + Serum Calcium (in mg/dL)",

She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.\nOne year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.\nLiver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.\nDuring her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count.

An emergent brain CT demonstrated acute traumatic subdural hematoma, thus an emergent decompressive craniectomy and hematoma removal was performed under general anesthesia without any remarkable incidences. After the first operation, the patient had not made favorable progresses, therefore several further operations such as brain abscess drainage, external ventricular drainage catheter insertion, cerebral lobectomy, ventriculoperitoneal shunt were performed during a 4 month period. Finally, the patient had cranioplasty.\nThe vital signs of the patient scheduled for cranioplasty were a systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 104 bpm, respiratory rate via tracheostomy 20 /min and the patient was still in a stuporous state. Preoperative laboratory data were within the normal range, and the chest X-ray revealed improvement of focal pneumonia and an arterial blood gas analysis in the tolerable range (ABGA; pH 7.418/PaCO2 39.5 mmHg/PaO2 104 mmHg with 2 L/min oxygen inhalation). An electrocardiogram (ECG) performed before the surgery showed sinus tachycardia, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a preserved global left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction; 69%). The preoperative brain CT sacn showed a marked shrinkage of the left cerebral hemisphere and an increase in ventricular size (). The general anesthesia was induced with 125 mg thiopental sodium and 50 mg rocuronium, without any premedication. The vital signs were monitored using noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), ECG and a pulse oximeter. The tracheostomy tube was changed for a 7.5 mm cuffed tracheostomy tube. Following the induction of anesthesia, the right dorsalis pedis artery was cannulated with a 22 gauge catheter, and the right femoral vein was cannulated with an 18 gauge catheter. General anesthesia was maintained with balanced anesthesia using oxygen-air-sevoflurane (0.5–1.5%) and supplementary remifentanil (4–6 µg/kg/h) infusion. Cranioplasty was carried out under controlled ventilation, keeping within 10% fluctuation of the vital signs and ETCO2 with intermittent injections of ephedrine, phenylephrine and esmolol. The ABGA was checked immediately after skin incision, and the results were a pH of 7.436, PaCO2 35.1 mmHg, PaO2 219.1 mmHg, and base excess –0.5. Intravenous fluid replacement consisted of 500 ml plasma solution and 50 ml lactated Ringer solution, and the estimated blood loss was 200 ml. After 2 hours of operation, the dura was closed, and the bony fragment was wired into place. Subsequently, drainage catheters were introduced into both the subgaleal and epidural spaces. By the time the scalp sutures were completed, a closed negative suction through the catheters had been applied. Approximately 30 seconds after suction drainage, sudden asystole of ECG, the disappearance of ETCO2 wave and a flat line arterial wave form were noticed. Instantly, the suction drainage was stopped, and we started external cardiac massage for approximately 20 seconds. Two times injections of 500 µg epinephrine were administered under the diagnosis of cardiac arrest. The cardiac rhythm was resumed to 120 bpm, and systolic blood pressure was regained to 150 mmHg immediately. The ABGA was checked after resuscitation, and the results were in the normal range (pH 7.418, PaCO2 39.5 mmHg, PaO2 103.3 mmHg and base excess 0.2). The patient was transferred to the NICU with a controlled AMBU bagging.\nHe went into a coma and showed partial spastic movement of extremities, suggesting a sudden increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). Emergent brain CT () revealed extensive diffuse brain swelling. Due to the fact that there were no specific causes of brain edema during the operation or general anesthesia, the negative vacuum suction drainage was presumed to be the main cause, resulting in the patient being diagnosed with PHBS. The patient received agents to reduce ICP, in addition to general supportive care with controlled ventilation. He improved gradually in the NICU, and reached a stuporous state with self-respiration 3 months postoperatively.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?\n\nAdjusted Body Weight: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg))",

His medical history included type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He had had type 2 diabetes for 10 years and was being treated at the time with vildagliptin, metformin, and dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin was added 8 months prior to admission. He reported a weight loss of 3 Kg following the commencing of dapagliflozin, but his weight appeared stable during the last 3 months. The A1C was 7.1% one month before admission. The patient noted that he suffered from recurrent episodes of abdominal pain the last 2 months.\nAt presentation the blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats/min, temperature 36.8°C, and oxygen saturation 98% on ambient air. The patient appeared mildly dehydrated with a BMI of 26.5 kg/m2. The abdomen was soft with mild tenderness in the epigastrium and left upper quadrant. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nAn arterial blood gas analysis was performed and revealed metabolic acidosis pH 7.33, HCO3− 10.9 mEq/L, and PCO2 21 mmHg with an increased anion gap at 29 mmol/L. Plasma glucose was mildly elevated at 203 mg/dL. Serum lactate was 1.1 mmol/L, i.e., within normal range. The rest of laboratory investigation was as follows: white blood cells 7860/μL, hemoglobin 14.8 g/dL, serum urea 84 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.33 mg/dL, Na+ 134 mmol/L, K+ 4.6 mmol/L, and Cl− 94 mmol/L. C-reactive protein level was moderately elevated at 8 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed glycosuria and ketonuria (glucose 4+, Oxone 4+). Measurement of serum ketones was not available.\nThe patient was diagnosed with euDKA possibly related to dapagliflozin use and was treated with intravenous fluids and insulin, with subsequent improvement of acid base disorders within the first 48 hours. He was also treated empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast was ordered to further evaluate the cause of the abdominal pain. The CT scan revealed ascending and transverse colonic dilatation proximal to a transition point in the splenic flexure and decompressed bowel distal to the obstruction, highly suspicious of colonic malignancy. Colonoscopy was then performed which showed splenic flexure cancer. The patient was transferred to the surgical clinic and underwent left hemicolectomy.

In her medical history, there was no known consanguinity between the parents. She had three healthy sisters without hirsutism and/or clitoromegaly. On physical examination, height was 140.5 cm [Standard deviation score (SDS): -3.5] and weight was 43.4 kg (Body mass index (BMI): 22.1, +0.8 SDS). Blood pressure was normal. She appeared to be of normal intelligence. Target height was 153.5 cm (SDS: -1.0). The patient’s breast development conformed to Tanner stage 1 and her pubic hair to Tanner stage 5. Facial acne, severe hirsutism with systemic skin hyperpigmentation, and clitoromegaly (4x1.5 cm) with a single urogenital orifice (Prader stage 4) were detected. There was no palpable gonad in the inguinal region.\nLaboratory findings revealed a LH level of 3.1 mIU/mL (N: 2.1-10.8) and a FSH level of 6.3 mIU/mL (N: 4.5-22). Estradiol level was <20 pg/mL, progesterone 31.9 ng/mL (N: 0.1-1.5), prolactin 12.6 ng/mL (N: 2.7-19.6), free thyroxine (fT4) 0.8 ng/mL (N: 0.6-1.4), and TSH 1.7 uIU/mL (N: 0.3-4.6). Serum sodium level was 138 mmol/L (N: 136-146) and potassium was 4.3 mmol/L (N: 3.5-5.1). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level was 319 pg/mL (N: 4.7-48.8), cortisol 7.8 ug/dL (N: 6.7-22.6), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) 720.6 µg/dL (N: 35-430), total testosterone 4.4 ng/mL (N: 0.1-0.7), androstenedione 13 ng/mL (N: 0.3-3.3), and 17-OHP level was below the detection limit (<0.05 ng/mL), (N: 0.2-1.3) ().\nACTH1-24 stimulated levels for 17-OHP, cortisol, and DHEA-S were <0.05 ng/mL, 8.03 ug/dL, and 750 ug/dL, respectively. The epiphyses were closed and the bone age was adult level. Pelvic ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a uterus (53x13x22 mm) with bilateral ovaries (2 mL/2.3 mL). Adrenal ultrasonography revealed adrenal hyperplasia. Karyotype was 46,XX.\nSurprisingly, initial and stimulated serum 17-OHP levels were very low, while the androgen levels were high. This unexpected result led to suspicion of a high-dose hook effect. The measurement was repeated after 1/10 dilution of serum, and a very high level of basal 17-OHP (115.4 ng/mL) was detected with the same test-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (DiaMetra, Segrate, Italy). The assay employs the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique.\nThese findings were in line with a diagnosis of the SV form of 21-OHD, and oral hydrocortisone (15 mg/m2/day) therapy was initiated. Two months later, the serum levels of androgens were still above normal limits () and, therefore, oral hydrocortisone was switched to oral dexamethasone (0.5 mg/day). At the clinical follow-up on this therapy, breast tissue progressed to Tanner stage 4 in three months. Clinical and laboratory findings at follow-up are shown in . After psychological evaluation, vaginoplasty and cliteroplasty were scheduled.\nTo confirm the diagnosis of 21-OHD, genetic analysis was performed from the DNA of peripheral blood leucocytes of the patient, and a previously known () homozygous missense p.I173N (c.518T>A) mutation in exon 4 of CYP21A2 gene was detected.

In the ED the mother was specifically asked about potential overdoses. She stated that there was a recently purchased bottle of acetaminophen in the garage where her son had been working. She had asked him to bring her the bottle; approximately five minutes later, he went into another room and she heard a gunshot.\nUpon arrival in the ED, the patient was intubated without medication. He had a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg, a pulse of 111 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 via bag-assisted respirations and a temperature of 36.5°C. Physical exam was notable for a single penetrating wound to the right temporal bone. Pupils were fixed and dilated. There was no evidence of trauma anywhere else on his body. The computed tomography scan of his brain demonstrated a non-survivable head injury with multiple skull fractures, intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subarachnoid and subdural blood. Additionally, there was significant cerebral edema with evidence of tonsillar herniation. The remainder of the physical exam was consistent with brain death, with no additional signs of trauma. Initial laboratories returned with a hemoglobin, 11 gm/dL; platelets, 218 103/mm3; sodium, 138 mEq/L; potassium, 2.9 mEq/L; chloride, 104 mEq/L; bicarbonate, 22 mEq/L; blood urea nitrogen, 12 mg/dL; and creatinine, 0.96 mg/dL. His aspartate transaminase (AST) was mildly elevated at 50 IU/L and his alanine transferase was normal at 20 IU/L. Initial international normalized ratio was 1.26. His acetaminophen level drawn at arrival was markedly elevated at 134 mg/L. The EPs initiated N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy and requested a medical toxicology consultation. Family expressed their interest in organ and tissue donation. The intensive care service requested input from the toxicology team with regard to immediate treatment for the patient, as well as timing and toxicological issues that could affect organ donation and transplantation.\nAfter conversations with the family, there was no further history available regarding potential ingestions or time of ingestion. An exact time of ingestion could not be determined. The family located the bottle and found approximately 20 grams of acetaminophen missing, an amount capable of producing fulminant hepatic failure. Given the lack of overdose information with evidence of a significant ingestion, intravenous NAC was continued indefinitely. Charcoal therapy was considered, but with the unknown time of ingestion and the duration of time elapsed from pre-hospital transportation through ED resuscitation, the patient was outside the window for likely therapeutic benefit.\nThe process of brain death evaluation was initiated. Our institutional policy for pediatric patients (defined as <18 years of age) is to have two separate brain death exams on separate calendar days. During this period, a multidisciplinary group of pediatric intensive care physicians and medical toxicologists participated in supportive care. Initial plans for heart, lung, and pancreas donation were decided, but the viability of the kidneys and liver were unknown. The next 24 hours of laboratory evaluation is summarized in .\nAfter the patient was declared brain dead, organs were recovered and transplanted into six different recipients. The heart, lung, pancreas and one of the kidneys were successfully transplanted, and at three months post transplant all organs were functioning well. The liver was split, with one recipient also receiving a kidney. The patient who received the right hemi-liver alone did not experience complications and had excellent allograft function at three months.

The insulin pump was taken off by the family just prior to presenting to the hospital. She presented to the hospital via emergency medical services, and her vital signs were normal upon arrival. Initial physical examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12 (eyes 3, verbal 4, motor 5) and the patient was localizing to pain on palpation of the right lower quadrant, without any other significant exam findings. Monitoring and intravenous (IV) access were established, and blood for laboratory evaluation was collected.\nThe patient was started on a lactated Ringer’s infusion. Her vital signs remained stable and upon re-evaluation, her GCS remained unchanged. With her clinical picture and previous history with DKA, initial concern was for DKA, although her initial point-of-care glucose was 109 mg/dL (reference 80–140 mg/dL) Subsequent point-of-care glucose readings showed decreasing levels less than 100 mg/dL (80–140 mg/dl) requiring glucose administration. Because of initial normal point-of-care glucose readings, the treating team pursued other causes of altered mental status. Initial labs were significant for a venous pH of 7.2 (7.35–7.45), bicarbonate of 8 mEq/L (21–28 mEq/L); anion gap of 33 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (4–12 mmol/L); lactate of 2 mmol/L (0.5–1 mmol/L); sodium 133 mEq/L (135–145 mEq/L); potassium 4.9 mEq/L (3.6–5.2 mEq/L); blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL (7–20 mg/dL); creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL (0.84–1.21 mg/dL); beta-hydroxybutyrate of 3.26 mmol/L (0.4–0.5 mmol/L); initial plasma glucose of 108 mg/dL (80–140/mg/dL); and leukocytosis of 20,600 per microliter (4500–11000 per microliter).\nUrine toxicology, salicylate, and acetaminophen screen and pregnancy test were negative. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the brain was unremarkable. She also had an IV contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen, which was suspicious for possible early appendicitis. With her resulting labs, other causes of elevated gap metabolic acidosis were considered. An endocrine consult was obtained for possible eDKA. Based on the consult and test results, the patient was started on an insulin drip at 0.1units per kilogram per hour as well as an infusion of a dextrose 10% solution.\nPediatric surgery was consulted, and after exam and review of the CT results recommended that the patient be taken to the operating room for an appendectomy. Surgical findings were noted to be equivocal and the appendix was removed without complication. The patient’s mental status improved post appendectomy. With fluid and insulin therapy her condition improved, laboratory abnormalities normalized within a few days, and she was subsequently discharged home.

This condition abruptly developed after climbing a mountain for 2 hr with a rucksack/back-pack weighing about 20 kg at 2 months previous to her hospital visit. At a certain moment, she felt the drooping shoulder with a popping sound. She was born via spontaneous full-term vaginal delivery with a normal APGAR score. She had no specific family history of nerve or muscle diseases. Her growth and developmental history was nonspecific before the onset of winged scapula. Upon the physical examination, a winging deformity of the right scapula was noticed with the lateral deviation and upward rotation of the inferior angle, as observed on the erect neutral posture (). This abnormality was not detected when both shoulders were abducted (), but it was aggravated by shoulder flexion (). The motor and sensory functions of the upper extremities were normal and no side to side differences were revealed. The deep tendon reflexes of the biceps and triceps muscles were normoactive and symmetrical. No significant muscle atrophy in the shoulder girdles and the upper extremities was observed. On the laboratory tests, the routine complete blood count with differential counting, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid arthritis factor and urinalysis were normal, and the muscle enzyme tests, including serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and transaminase, were also normal. Simple radiological studies, including the chest posterior-anterior view, both the shoulder anterior-posterior views and the scapular view, were nonspecific except for the slight scapular asymmetry.\nWe examined the nerves by conducting an electrodiagnostic examination that included the long thoracic nerve, the dorsal scapular nerve and the spinal accessory nerves and the muscles including serratus anterior, levator scapula, trapezius and rhomboideus and so on; there were no definitive evidences that indicated any neuropathy or myopathy on electrodiagnosis.\nWhen the pain and functional impairment persisted, surgical intervention then became appropriate. An explorative operation was done. A posterior longitudinal skin incision was made parallel to the vertebral border of the scapula. The subcutaneous tissue was divided. We can observed that the rhomboidius major was ruptured and trapezius lower thoracic bundle displayed thinning (). The right scapula was unstable to the chest wall. Rhomboideus major and trapezius muscle repair and reefing were performed. After the muscle repair, the scapula was stable to chest wall at the time of the operation.\nPostoperatively, she achieved the anatomical restoration of her right shoulder and she received rehabilitative treatment for 2 weeks including range of motion exercise of the shoulder and strengthening exercise of the rhomboideus muscles. On the follow up examination, at 2 months after the operation, there was no weakness or deformity of the affected shoulder and no pain nor limitation of shoulder motion.

In the last 4 months, he had anorexia, asthenia, and difficulty to swallow any food. When he tried to eat, he felt nausea and sometimes vomited. He had lost 7 kg. He denied fever or other symptoms. He was an active smoker that had smoked 100 pack-years. He did not abuse alcohol or other drugs. He had arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus with HbA1c: 6.5% one month earlier and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He had presented three no disabling ischemic strokes. He was taking hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, and acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, once a day; and captopril 50 mg TID. His father died of sudden death at 83 years old, and his mother died of stroke at 80 years old. His brother died of esophageal cancer with 55 years old. He lived with his wife. His physical examination revealed an alert, oriented man, with blood pressure: 120/70 mmHg; heart rate: 72 bpm; respiratory rate: 20 rpm; axillary temperature: 36°C; pulse oximetry: 95%; weight: 33.5 kg; height: 1.53 m; BMI: 14.3 kg/m2. There were several lymph nodes the cervical region, the larger one with 1.5 cm, and digital clubbing. Other aspects of his physical examination were normal. Two months before admission, chest radiography showed signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, micronodules and linear opacities in the upper lobes, and a small consolidation in the lower left lobe. The initial laboratory evaluation revealed hemoglobin = 8.6 g/dL (normal range: 13–14.2 g/dL); VCM = 88.9 fL (80–100 fL); leukocytes = 7220/μL (4000–10000/μL); neutrophils = 2758/μL (1800–7500/μL); eosinophils = 606/μL (40–500/μL); basophils = 87/μL (<100/μL); monocytes = 477/μL (120–1000/μL); lymphocytes = 3292/μL (1000–4000/μL); platelets: 409000/μL (150–400 × 103/μL); serum sodium: 134 mEq/L (135–145 mEq/L); potassium: 5.2 mEq/L (3.5–5.1 mEq/L); creatinine: 0.64 mg/dL (0.5–1.2 mg/dL); ureic nitrogen: 21 mg/dL (5–20 mg/dL); calcium: 7.8 mg/dL (8.5–10.4 mg/dL); albumin: 3.0 g/dL (3.5–5.0 g/dL); ALT: 17 U/L (<31U/L); glucose: 94/mg/dL (70–99 mg/dL). An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was normal, and a nasojejunal tube was inserted. The patient remained with the same symptoms, receiving food and liquids through a nasojejunal tube. In the sixth day after admission, after being submitted to chest and abdomen computerized tomography, he developed fever (39.5°C), confusion, blood pressure 160/110 mmHg, heart rate: 120 bpm, pulse oximetry: 95%. He received intravenous dipyrone. A few moments later, his blood pressure dropped to 80/40 mmHg, and intravenous saline solution was infused. A blood sample to measure serum ACTH and cortisol was drawn. In the next two days, he had no fever, and two samples of blood culture were negative. In the following days, the patient developed severe hyponatremia (sodium = 122 mEq/L and 119 mEq/L), and postural hypotension was identified (supine resting = 122/60 mmHg and standing = 100/60 mmHg). The results of computed tomography of chest and abdomen are shown in Figures and . Serum cortisol and ACTH were, respectively, 1.03 μg/dL (4.3–22.4 μg/dL) and 626 pg/mL (12–46 pg/mL), and serum TSH was 8.06 μU/mL (0.35–5.5 μU/mL). The patient received intravenous hydrocortisone, and hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. Electrolyte abnormalities, anorexia, and difficulty to swallow are resolved. A biopsy of the left adrenal gland showed signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma with areas of necrosis. In the immunohistochemical study, the cells were positive for CK7, TTF-1, and CEA, and negative for CK20, vimentin, CA19.9, CD10, prostatic specific antigen, and thyroglobulin. Therefore, the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin was made. Bone and brain metastases were not evident in bone scintigraphy and brain computerized tomography. A few days later, the patient was switched to 5 mg oral prednisone and 0.1 mg of fludrocortisone and was discharged to his home.

Review of systems was negative for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fever, or chills. The patient was passing flatus but denied any bowel movements for four days.\nOn physical examination, bowel sounds were decreased, and the patient’s abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation. Heart sounds were normal, and lungs were clear to auscultation.\nReview of medication history revealed that the patient had been taking propranolol for primary prevention of variceal bleed for three years since being diagnosed with cirrhosis.\nPertinent laboratory values were as follows: sodium = 133 mEq/L (low [L]), potassium = 4.4 mEq/L (normal [nl]), chloride = 105 mEq/L (nl), BUN (blood urea nitrogen) = 16 mg/dL (nl), creatinine = 0.9 mg/dL (nl), white blood cell = 3.9 k/uL (L), hemoglobin = 9.0 g/dL (L), platelet = 204 k/uL (nl), lactate = 2.8 mmol/L (high [H]), AST (aspartate aminotransferase) = 53 U/L (H), ALT (alanine aminotransferase) = 16 U/L (H), GGT (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) = 223 U/L (H), direct bilirubin = 0.3 mg/dL (H), total bilirubin = 1.1 mg/dL (nl), alkaline phosphatase = 160 U/L (H), total protein = 6.0 g/dL (L), albumin = 3.2g/dL (L), and bicarbonate = 22 mEq/L (L).\nInitial workup included an abdominal CT scan, which showed mobile loops of bowel with air-fluid levels concerning for ileus versus small bowel obstruction. However, given that the patient was passing gas, concern for complete bowel obstruction was low, and conservative medical management was recommended by the consulted surgical team.\nReview of the previous medical records showed this patient to have a history of recurrent admissions for unremitting, diffuse abdominal pain. During a surgery to relieve his bowel obstruction approximately two years prior, a thick fibrous tissue encapsulating the ileum, jejunum, gallbladder, stomach, transverse colon, and omentum was noticed. Additionally, a separate fibrous capsule was found that encapsulated the aforementioned structures and fibrous sheath. The distal ileum was found to be completely decompressed, consistent with a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction. To relieve the obstruction, the thick fibrous tissue encasing the ileum and jejunum had to be excised. Some of the fibrous casing had to be left intact to preserve the integrity of bowel tissues.\nCT images from two years prior are shown in Figures , .\nDuring this admission, however, the patient’s bowel obstruction was managed conservatively.

            "input": "The subject was a 14-year-old female patient with EDS hypermobile type. She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().\nEDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.\nThe AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.\nIn the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.\nThe intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

            "input": "A 49-year-old male presented to our hospital complaining of chest pain. For the past few years the patient reported experiencing intermittent chest pains at night. In addition to the chest pain, the patient developed pyrexia and perspiration beginning a week before admission. He initially visited another hospital for worsening symptoms where examination found abnormal electrocardiography results (the ST elevation in leads aVL and V1 to V6), leukocytosis, and abnormal liver function tests. Echocardiography revealed a decreased cardiac output with regional wall motion abnormality. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) results showed hepatic parenchymal abnormality and a tumor on the left adrenal gland. The patient was transferred to the reporting hospital with these results.\nSeven years prior to presentation the patient had been diagnosed with hypertension and was put on antihypertensive medication, but remained poorly controlled over the 3 years prior to presentation. He was also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 8 years ago and has been treated with hypoglycemic agents, but his blood sugar was poorly controlled. There was no other medical history.\nOn admission, his blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg with a pulse rate of 66 beats per minute, was breathing at a rate of 20 times per minute, and had a body temperature of 36.8℃. He had clear consciousness without signs of conjunctival pallor, scleral jaundice, dehydration, and absent dilatation of the jugular vein. On chest auscultation breath sounds were clear without wheezing or crackles detected. Cardiac auscultation revealed a heartbeat that was regular without murmur. On examining the abdomen, bowel sounds seemed reduced and the right upper abdomen had slight but not significant tenderness. No masses were detected on abdomen. No limb edema was seen.\nTwo days prior to admission, the patient had been tested in another hospital. Blood tests resulted as follows: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 444 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 469 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 1,153 IU/L, white blood cell count 50,000/µL, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative, anti-HBsAb positive, antihepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) antibody (Ab) negative, antihepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) Ab negative, and anti-HAV IgG Ab positive. On the day of admission to our hospital, the blood test results were as follows: hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, white blood cell count 59,360/µL, platelet count 244,000/µL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 4 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein 3.446 mg/L, blood urea nitrogen 22.7 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.76 mg/dL, serum calcium 7.2 mg/dL, inorganic phosphorous 2.0 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, and potassium 4.4 mmol/L. The results also showed that total protein was 5.5 g/dL, albumin was 2.7 g/dL, AST 156 IU/L and ALT 317 IU/L, ALP 289 IU/L, and total bilirubin 1.05 mg/dL. Hemoglobin A1c was 10.7%. At fasting, C-peptide was 0.40 ng/mL (range, 0.48 to 3.3), and 2 hours after a meal it was 0.66 ng/mL. Lactate dehydrogenase was 1,240 IU/L. Creatine kinase MB and troponin-T were found to be 5.99 ng/mL (range, 0.6 to 6.3) and 0.073 ng/mL (range, 0.0 to 0.1), respectively.\nChest X-ray found no abnormal finding. Abdominal CT at another hospital detected several small-sized and low attenuation lesions on both lobes of the liver, and a 5×5-cm-sized tumor enhanced unevenly on the left adrenal gland ().\nElectrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion and QT interval prolongation observed in leads II and V1 to V6 (). Although the cardiac ejection fraction was 69%, echocardiography detected severely hypokinetic wall motion of mid-left ventricle sparing basal and apical wall motions.\nThe tumor on the left adrenal gland was tested for hormones. The results of 24 hours urinalysis were as follows: vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) 33.93 mg/day (range, 0 to 8.0), metanephrines 20.45 mg/day (range, 0 to 1.3), epinephrine 2,034 µg/day (range, 0 to 40), norepinephrine 978 µg/day (range, 0 to 80), serum epinephrine 1,221 pg/mL (range, 0 to 120), and serum norepinephrine 778 pg/mL (range, 100 to 410). Other tests including aldosterone, plasma renin activity, and cortisol were all normal. On 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan examination, uptake of the radioactive isotope was increased in the left adrenal gland, but no other lesions were found ().\nBased on the examination results above, the patient was diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma on the left adrenal gland. On the 12th day of admission oral phenoxybenzamine administration was started, and blood pressure was followed after having ceased all previous antihypertensives. The dosage of phenoxybenzamine was increased to 35 mg/day. After 19 days of administration, resection of the left adrenal gland was performed under laparoscope. The size of the resected tumor was 5×5 cm, and the surface was a mixture of a hemorrhagic and a cystic lesion. The tissue pathological examination showed the tumor cells with eosinophillic cytoplasm and polygonal shape surrounded by mesenchyma of vasculature on H&E staining, while immunohistochemical stains of chromogranin, synaptophysin, and S-100 immunoperoxidase staining revealed the proper findings to diagnose pheochromocytoma as positive (). Thirteen days after tumor resection a panel of endocrine tests was performed to follow-up on the pheochromocytoma. A 24 hours urinalysis showed a VMA of 6.51 mg/day with metanephrines at 0.61 mg/day, epinephrine at <5 µg/day, norepinephrine at 101.48 µg/day, serum epinephrine at <15 pg/mL, and serum norepinephrine at 536.60 pg/mL (). When first admitted, the patient had uncontrolled blood pressure even with amlodipine 10 mg and irbesartan 150 mg plus 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. However, when discharged, the patient had controlled blood pressure with a reduced dosage of antihypertensives consisting of amlodipine 10 mg and irbesartan 150 mg.\nPrior to his admission to the outside hospital, the patient had no history of new drug administration that might cause liver function failure. He also had no history of drinking and had a normal body weight (body mass index 23 kg/m2). A panel for hepatic viral disease (hepatitis B virus, HCV, HAV) was negative, and no abnormality was found through immunological testing (antismooth muscle, antinuclear, antimitochondria antibody), or screening for genetic diseases (plasma iron parameters, ceruloplasmin, Cu). This led to the challenge of finding a clear cause for the liver function failure. The liver function improved with conservative treatment, and had resolved by the time phenoxybenzamine was administered (). On the 22nd day after left adrenal gland resection, AST and ALT had normalized at 23 and 25 IU/L, respectively (), and normal liver function test remained within normal limits at 80 days after surgery.\nAfter admission to our hospital, the patient's leukocytosis continued, and follow-up tests were performed to examine for secondary causes such as blood diseases, infection, and pheochromocytoma. On the fourth day of phenoxybenzamine administration the white blood cell count had recovered to 5,900/µL and continued to be within the normal range even after surgery ().\nEchocardiography indicated cardiac ejection fraction of 78% on the 15th day after admission (fourth day of phenoxybenzamine administration), and no left ventricle wall motion abnormalities were observed.\nOn admission the patient was administered insulin and metformin, but the range of blood glucose fluctuation was wide. However, after surgery blood glucose levels returned to the normal range without the previously administered medications. Previously suppressed C-peptide secretion was recovered 3 days after surgery. On the 80th day after surgery, the hemoglobin A1c was measured found to be 5.7% ().\n\nWhat is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?\n\nFibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT)",

ESP block was planned as part of her multimodal analgesia protocol.\nAfter premedication (midazolam 1 mg), anesthesia induction was performed using lidocaine 1 mg/kg, fentanyl 100 mcg, propofol 3 mg/kg, and rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg. Following intubation, anesthesia was maintained with 0.6 MAC sevoflurane in air-oxygen mixture and remifentanil infusion of 0.08–0.1μg/kg/min.

The symptoms started a month prior for which she visited her primary medical doctor and was treated for pneumonia. Her symptoms continued to persist and gradually worsen at which point she was also treated with tamiflu for influenza. Her other symptoms however continued to progress and consisted of fever, chills, cough, body aches, and shortness of breath. The patient is a non-smoker, drinks alcohol socially, and works in a pharmacy.\nOn physical examination, the patient was tachycardia with a heart rate of 118, blood pressure of 111/72, respiratory rate of 24, and was saturating 88% on room air. At the time, she was afebrile with a temperature of 99.1 °F. Significant findings on examination showed diffuse rhonchi bilaterally with crackles on lung examination. Laboratory data demonstrated hemoglobin of 13, hematocrit of 39, white blood cell of 10.9, and platelets of 344,000. Sodium was 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 98, bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 15, creatinine 1.0, and glucose of 113. Troponins were negative. D-dimer was elevated at 0.71 and CT angiogram (CTA) was conducted to rule out pulmonary embolism. CTA of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed tree-in bud changes in the right upper lobe suspicious for an infectious or inflammatory process (). Similar findings were also seen in the right lower lobe. There were linear changes in the lower lobes bilaterally which most likely represented atelectasis and there was a 7.6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe.\nThe patient was admitted to telemetry for the management of pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone initially. Patient was found to be positive for Mycoplasma pneumonia and medications were adjusted accordingly. Patient continued to have persistent hypoxia and continued to desaturate to 88% upon ambulation. She was later found to have hemophilus influenza growth in sputum culture, which was properly being managed by her antibiotic regimen. During her hospital stay, although the patient was receiving solumedrol and antibiotics she continued to have diffuse bilateral crackles and productive cough. Patient was found to have leukocytosis as high as 19.6, but this could be attributed to her steroid treatment. However, this train of thought remained unclear as the patient was also found to have a bandemia of 21. Her antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were adjusted to consist of doxycycline, zyvox, and fluconazole. The patient continued to deteriorate and systemic workup including allergy test, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (cANCA), perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), purified protein derivative (PPD), QuantiFERON, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test was all conducted. Full systemic workup returned negative for any findings. After completing her course of antibiotics, she was also removed from her steroids but would continue to desaturate and lung findings remained unchanged. Patient underwent bronchoscopy but no significant mass or lesion was found to biopsy and her postoperative diagnosis remained as non-resolving pneumonia. Repeat CT scan was performed which showed minimal improvement and continue to suggest pneumonia and possibly underlying interstitial lung disease ().\nThe patient was scheduled for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure with biopsy of the right middle and lower lobes. Right lower lobe wedge biopsy on pathology showed lung parenchyma with consolidation, atelectasis, and areas of fibrosis (). Right mid lung biopsy also showed foci of consolidation but also consisted of varying stages of questionable emphysema (). As the findings were highly unusual and emphysematous changes were not found on patient’s CT scans, the pathology was sent to a specialist, who confirmed the results but again noted them to be very non-specific. The patient’s post-operative status was complicated and patient desaturated overnight and required intubation. Alpha-1 antitrypsin was sent but returned elevated. The patient was successfully extubated after 2 days. She was placed back on steroids and was clinically improving over the course of another 1 week. Her pulse oximetry however on room air remained around 86% even after a week of steroids and thus the patient would be discharged on home oxygen therapy. Pulmonary function tests were significant for a forced vital capacity (FVC) moderately reduced at 1.65 L (60%), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) severely reduced at 0.98 L (40%), FEV1/FVC ratio reduced at 59%, and MVV severely reduced at 28%. Flow volume loop demonstrated a combined obstructive and restrictive contour (). Lung volumes showed a vital capacity reduced at 1.65 L (60%), total lung capacity (TLC) reduced at 2.08 L (56%), and residual volume (RV) reduced at 0.43 L (43%). Her diffusion capacity (DLCO) was also severely reduced at 38%. These findings were suggestive of combined severe, irreversible obstructive and restrictive lung disease with severely reduced diffusion capacity. She would follow up with infectious disease and a pulmonary specialist as an outpatient for further workup and repeat CT scan in 3 weeks with further discussion with regard to possible lung transplant options.\n\nWhat is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?\n\nSerum Osmolality: sOsm = 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18)",

            "input": "The case we present was a 71-year-old Japanese man. When he was being treated for pneumonia at another hospital, CT image incidentally revealed a BT and mild right-sided hydronephrosis (Fig. ) without metastasis. After his pneumonia had been cured, the patient was referred to the SIMC to receive treatment for his BT (SIMC-Uro# 11116, a unique non-sequential patient control number issued at the Department of Uro-Oncology, SIMC). At his first visit, the patient's physical (height: 1.56 m, weight: 48.9 kg) and routine laboratory data were within the normal ranges. He had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, which required regular insulin injections. MRI showed many BTs (Figs –). The largest tumor detected on MRI is indicated by the blue arrowhead in Figure a. The tumor indicated by the yellow arrowhead was observed as it progressed between the right ureteral wall (white arrowhead in Figure a) and bladder wall (red arrowhead). Moreover, a tumor was found within the right orifice of the ureter (green arrowhead), which had presumably caused the mild right-sided hydroureter (“u” in Figure a, see also Figures –). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with bladder carcinoma, which was suspected to have infiltrated into the ureter (green arrowhead). No apparent muscle invasion, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis was observed (clinical classification: T1, N0, M0, according to the classification of the Union for International Cancer Control).\nThe patient underwent oral-PDD-TUR-BT (20 mg/kg of 5-ALA was administered 2 hours before surgery) using the D-LIGHT system (Table ). As suggested by MRI (blue arrowhead in Figure a), the main papillary tumor was located on the right ureteral orifice (blue arrowhead in Figure b), and it clearly emitted fluorescence under blue light (Fig. c). It had invaded the bladder neck, the prostatic urethra, and the right posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). In addition, three daughter tumors were found on the posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). Random bladder biopsy samples were obtained from the surrounding normal tissue (the posterior, left, and right walls) and the tumor-infiltrated tissue (the bladder neck and prostatic urethra). Subsequently, we deeply resected the largest tumor (Fig. b,c). The right ureteral orifice was exposed, and it was found to have been blocked by papillary tumors (the tumors in the ureter and the ureteral wall are indicated by green and white arrowheads, respectively; Fig. d,e). We deeply resected the tumors in the ureteral orifice; however, after the resection procedure residual tumors were identified within the ureteral orifice (green arrowhead in Figure f), which emitted potent fluorescence under blue light (Fig. g, see also Video ). We decided to attempt to remove the remaining tumors. After the second and third attempts to resect the ureteral tumors (deep resections, Video ), no tumors were visible under white light in the right ureter (Fig. h); however, marked fluorescence was observed from the ureteral mucosa (Fig. i), which was indicative of residual cancer. If the patient had undergone TUR without PDD, we would have finished the surgery at this point. Instead, we performed a biopsy of the fluorescence-emitting tissue. We then attempted to remove the suspected residual carcinoma. After the fourth resection of the ureteral orifice, the hydroureter-affected lumen was exposed, the mucosa of which was smooth and did not emit fluorescence (Fig. j,k). Subsequently, we performed a biopsy of the ureteral mucosa (Video ).\nThe pathological diagnosis of the BT was low-grade urothelial carcinoma, which had not invaded the muscular layer (pTa). No cancer cells were detected in random biopsy specimens. As expected from the PDD, low-grade cancer cells were detected in the ureteral mucosa after the third resection of the ureteral orifice, in which an irregular and fluorescent mucosa was identified (Fig. h,i). On the other hand, no cancer cells were found in the smooth and non-fluorescent mucosa after the fourth resection procedure. To prevent tumor recurrence, the patient is currently being treated with intravesically administered BCG via a right ureteral stent, which exposes both the ureter and the bladder to BCG. We concluded that the ureteral tumor was a BT that had infiltrated into the ureter because (i) preoperative MRI (Fig. a) showed that the main tumor was located in the bladder, (ii) the hydronephrosis was mild (CT findings, Figure ; the hydronephrosis would have been severe if the ureteral tumor had originated from the ureteral orifice), and (iii) the pathological analyses did not show muscular invasion. Thus, we succeeded in resecting the tumor in the ureteral orifice, which was accomplished via PDD using orally administered 5-ALA.\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

Thiopental 250 mg, lidocaine 40 mg, and rocuronium 40 mg were administered intravenously. Endotracheal intubation was done successfully without complication. After intubation, the lung sound on both lung fields was remarkable and tube was fixed at 21 cm. For maintenance of anesthesia, oxygen 2 L/min, N2O 2 L/min, sevoflurane (1.2-2.0 vol%) were administered, and remifentanil was continuously infused 0.1-0.2 µg/kg/min. Volume-control ventilation was maintained with a tidal volume of 450 ml, with respiration rate of 12/min. Airway pressure was maintained to 20 cmH2O, whereas partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) was kept to 35-38 mmHg. When one hour passed after induction, PETCO2 was reduced to 32 mmHg and tidal volume and respiration rate were controlled to 450 ml and 10/min respectively. Airway pressure was maintained to 19 cmH2O.\nThe patient's position during surgery was a beach chair position. Blood pressure and heart rate were maintained 100-130/60-80 mmHg and 54-85 beats/min, respectively; there were no remarkable events throughout the entire surgical procedure. After the surgery, pyridostigmine 15 mg and glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg were given for reversal of muscle relaxation. Extubation was achieved after confirmation of self-respiration and consciousness recovery. The patient was transferred to the PACU. Total operation time was 145 minutes and, whereas total anesthesia time was 175 minutes.

Postoperative pain control was achieved by fentanyl 800 µg and ketorolac 90 mg along with ramosetron 0.3 mg mixed to normal saline 80 ml. A patient-controlled analgesia device (Accufuser Plus®, Woo Young Medical, Korea; flow rate 1 ml/hr, bolus volume 1 ml, lock out time 15 min) was employed to deliver the medication intravenously for pain control.\nAt 5 hours after the end of surgery, she complained of facial edema with a lot of sputum tingeing with a small amount of blood. Vital signs were 160/80 mmHg for blood pressure, 98 beats/min for heart rate, 36.3℃ for body temperature and 96% for oxygen saturation. After 30 minutes, she complained of severe respiratory difficulty and the oxygen saturation was decreased to 91-95%. 3 L/min of oxygen was supplied immediately by nasal cannula, and then the saturation on the pulse oximetry was maintained to 98%. A chest x-ray and a chest CT scan were taken for evaluation of dyspnea. On chest x-ray () and chest CT scan, it was discovered that there were subcutaneous and intermuscular emphysema on the patient's face and neck, and pneumomediastinum (). Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination was performed by an otolaryngologist with the patient in a waking state, and there were no remarkable findings except a mild laceration in the oral cavity.\nPneumomediastinum was confirmed so that an antitussive agent, antibiotics and 5 L/min of oxygen were administered for treatment.

            "input": "Female, 63 years old, was admitted to our hospital suffering from weakness, fainting and dizziness at a time of hypoglycemia, memory decline and decreased attention. She had experienced episodes of such symptoms during the previous 2 years. Hypoglycemia with a glucose level of 2.0 mmol/l had been detected during one of the episodes. For the next several months, the patient did not take any diagnostic tests. In 2017, the frequency of the hypoglycemic episodes increased. A fasting test was performed 2 years after the first episode in June 2018. The results showed hypoglycemia 0.91 mmol/l (normal range 3.0–5.5 mmol/l), insulin 54.4 mkE/ml (normal range 3–26 mkE/ml) and c-peptide 5,51 ng/ml (normal range 0.79–4,19 ng/ml). The patient was admitted to our hospital in normal condition. Her BMI was 39 kg/m2; total weight gain was 20 kg since the disease onset.\nA transabdominal and endoscopic ultrasound also did not reveal any pathological findings in the pancreas. Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI scans of the abdominal cavity were then performed. A tumor of the pancreas was not revealed, although a pathologic mass in the sixth segment of the liver was detected ().\nDue to being unable to identify a tumor of the pancreas and the pathological finding in the liver, we made a decision to perform arterial calcium stimulation with hepatic venous sampling (ASVS). The analysis showed increased insulin and c-peptide levels in almost all stimulated arteries. Moreover, the highest and most prolonged peaks of insulin and c-peptide levels were detected at the points of the common hepatic artery and the right hepatic artery (). This became the most important finding for further treatment.\nTherefore, all performed diagnostic procedures (transabdominal US, endoscopic US, CT, MRI and ASVS) could not reveal a pancreatic tumor. However, the lesion of the liver looked like a neuroendocrine neoplasm.\nExplorative laparotomy was then performed. Intraoperatively, the pancreatic texture was soft and surrounded by peripancreatic fat tissue without any signs of atrophy or sclerosis. Visualization and palpation of the pancreas did not reveal any tumor. But a soft encapsulated tumor 4 cm in size was found in the sixth segment of the liver. An intra-operative ultrasound was performed. There were no tumors either of the pancreas or of the liver other than the neoplasm described above. Hence, a decision to remove the tumor of the liver was made. This was performed using a bipolar and harmonic ace with minimal organ trauma. The frozen section confirmed a neuroendocrine tumor. The glucose level became 9–10 mmol/l right after the procedure, and no glucose infusions were required.\nHistological and immunohystochemical analysis showed a well-differentiated insulin-producing neuroendocrine tumor of grade 2. Ki67 was 4% with positive reaction with Synaptophysin (MRQ-40, Cell Marque): ++; Chromogranin A (DAK-A3, DAKO): ++; CD56 (123C3.D5, Cell Marque): ++ and Insulin (polyclonal, DAKO): +++ ().\nPost-operative recovery was uneventful. There were no episodes of hypoglycemia. The range of glucose blood levels was 6–8 mmol/l. The patient was discharged for outpatient checkup on the 14th day after the surgery. During the 2 weeks after the operation, the body weight decreased by 8.5 kg (8.7% of body mass).\nLong-term results were assessed on the 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after the surgery. Every 3 months, contrast-enhanced CT and MRI scans were performed. A year after the surgery, a PET/CT scan was also performed. None of the tests revealed any pathological findings or signs of neuroendocrine tumor.

His recent medical history started 15 days ago, at the beginning of January, when he presented to the emergency room (ER) of the regional hospital with fever (up to 40°C), chills, and productive cough for three days prior to his admission. He had no history of chronic diseases or drug abuse. His kidney function was normal (serum creatinine 0.95 mg/dL) a year before. He was a smoker and he worked as a cook in a local hotel from April to October each year.\nAt presentation to the ER he was febrile (39.2°C), blood pressure (BP) was 135/79 mmHg, and pulse was 76 beats per minute. His oxygen saturation was 91.6% in room air, with blood gas showing pH = 7.53, pO2 = 55 mmHg, pCO2 = 32 mmHg, and FiO2 = 21%. Auscultation of the chest revealed diffuse bilateral crackles. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. A chest radiograph showed bilateral lower lung infiltrates and a computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse bilateral opacities in the lower lobes ().\nLaboratory tests on admission showed normal white blood cells (4230/mm3, 89% neutrophils, 7% lymphocytes, and 1.7% monocytes), hematocrit at 33.3%, hyponatremia (Na 128 mmol/L), markedly elevated C-reactive protein levels (60 mg/dL), and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (90 mm/min). The rest of his work-up showed serum creatinine 1.23 mg/dL, blood urea 57 mg/dL, AST 80 IU, ALT 44 IU, CPK 523 IU/L, and LDH 402 IU/L (). Urinalysis showed 2+ proteinuria, while sediment showed 1-2 erythrocytes and 1-2 leukocytes per high-power field. The patients' blood cultures, viral serologies (EBV, CMV, HCV, HBV, and HIV), and skin test for tuberculosis (PPD test) were negative.\nThe patient was started on combined antibiotic treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam, moxifloxacin, and oseltamivir with considerable improvement of his fever, respiratory symptoms, signs, and radiological findings over the next few days. However, his renal function gradually declined with serum creatinine increasing to 2.52 mg/dL and blood urea to 91 mg/dL at Day 3. Due to the combined pulmonary and renal disease the suspicion of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) due to systemic vasculitis was hypothesized and pulse steroid treatment at a dose of 500 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone daily was initiated at Day 4, and the patient was referred to our department at Day 8, for further evaluation and treatment.\nAt presentation in our department, the patient was afebrile, BP was at 158/80 mmHg, pulse was 71 beats per minute, respiratory rate was at 25 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation was 94% in room air. Blood gas showed pH = 7.35, pO2 = 80.5 mmHg, pCO2 = 20.7 mmHg, HCO3 = 11.1 mmol/L, ABE = −13.1 mmol/L, and sO2 = 94% while auscultation revealed crackles at the lower lobes of his lungs. He had pitting peripheral edema while his urinary output was normal. The rest of the clinical examination was unremarkable. His laboratory testing showed elevated serum creatinine 3.42 mg/dL and urea 165 mg/dL. However, urine analysis was once again normal (1-2 erythrocytes and 0–2 leukocytes, no casts, and no abnormal erythrocytes) and proteinuria was at 800 mg/24 h. A renal ultrasound showed slightly enlarged kidneys (right, 11.5 cm and left, 12.4 cm) with increased width of cortex (1.5 cm and 2.6 cm). Although the diagnosis of pulmonary and renal failure were evident, due to the absence of nephritic syndrome and the very short period of renal function decline, the diagnosis of RPGN and, therefore, Goodpasture syndrome of any cause could not be supported. Further, the patient had no clinical or radiology signs of lung haemorrhage. At this point the differential diagnosis for his acute kidney injury (AKI) included prerenal AKI due to decrease in renal blood supply at his previous hospitalization (not supported by the referral letter information) and renal AKI due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) induced by drug agents or AIN caused by drugs or microbial agents. For these reasons the pulse methylprednisolone treatment was stopped when 3 gr in total was reached and followed by oral methylprednisolone at a dose of 48 mg daily with fast tapering. Piperacillin-tazobactam was stopped at Day 9 as it is an agent that could cause ATN or AIN. The patient was supported with conservative measures (including diuretics), with respiratory symptoms, signs, and BP normalizing over the next 2-3 days and his peripheral edema gradually resolving. Over the next days serum immunology testing (IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM, rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, serum protein electrophoresis, and immunoglobulin-free κ/λ chains) was negative, confirming the differential diagnosis.\nWith the patient at stable condition, renal function slightly improved but reached a plateau between Day 10 and Day 12 (serum creatinine 3.52, urea 188 mg/dL). On this basis, moxifloxacin was also interrupted at Day 13, as it could also be a causative factor for AIN, and an ultrasound guided biopsy was performed to diagnose AKI of renal origin at Day 15. Light microscopy showed evidence of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with interstitial edema and inflammatory peritubular infiltrations composed mainly of lymphocytes. The glomeruli had evidence of nonspecific mild mesangial enlargement, with no abnormalities of the glomerular basement membrane (). Immunofluorescence showed no evidence of immune deposits. On this basis further testing for Hantaan virus and Legionella pneumophila antigen was ordered, while a more detailed record of the patient's history revealed that the patient had recently worked for two nights as a cook in his hotel, which opened only for a weekend over the holiday season. On this basis, the diagnosis of AIN due to Legionella pneumophila was confirmed by a positive antigen test at the urine sample returning at Day 21.\nAfter the biopsy the patient was in a stable condition, with his renal function progressively improving with oral steroid use tapered to a dose of 4 mg per week. He was discharged from our hospital at Day 22 with his serum creatinine at 1.87 mg/dL at 28 mg methylprednisolone daily (). He was closely followed up in the Outpatient Department with serum creatinine at 1.53 mg/dL at 1 month after discharge and returned to normal (0.88 mg/dL) at two months after discharge () with cessation of steroid treatment.\n\nUsing the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nMDRD GFR Equation: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient, where race_coefficient is 1.212 for black patients and 1.0 for non-black parients, and gender_coefficient is 1 for men and 0.742 for women",

            "input": "A 45-year-old, 58 kg, 156 cm woman presented with increased and prolonged vaginal bleedings. A physical examination and an ultrasound showed a submucosal leiomyoma of the uterus. There were no other symptoms or pathological findings. Preoperative blood tests, which included electrolytes analyses, a full blood exam, and coagulation parameters, showed no anomalies. Most notably, both creatinine and sodium were within normal levels, i.e. 0.7 mg/dL and 137 mEq/L, respectively. The patient had a history of encephalopathy during childhood of an unknown origin without sequelae, an elective caesarean section (1997) due to leiomyoma, laparoscopic myomectomy and removal of an endometrial cyst of the ovary (1999), and a second caesarean section (2000) due to an uterine instability subsequent to the first caesarean section and myomectomy. The patient had no known allergies. She was taking daily doses of ethinyl estradiol (0.02 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.1 mg) continuously over a period of six months. The patient refused a hysterectomy but an endoscopic removal of the leiomyoma and an endometrial ablation was decided on, subsequent to which the patient gave written informed consent. The patient was administered with 7.5 mg midazolam orally 60 min preoperatively. Subsequent to placing the patient in the lithotomy position, the application of a peripheral venous catheter and the attachment of standard monitoring equipment (electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure cuff and a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation analyzer), anaesthesia was induced intravenously with propofol (2 mg/kg) and sufentanil (0.3 μg/kg).\nA laryngeal mask was inserted, and after the correct positioning was verified, the lungs were ventilated with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 and a minute volume (MV) of 74 mL/min/kg at a ventilation frequency of 10/min in volume controlled mode (IPPV). The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level was 0 Pa and the peak pressure was 900 Pa. Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol (8 mg/kg/h). After anaesthesiological clearance the endoscopy commenced. Purisole® SM (Fresenius Kabi Inc., Germany) was utilized as the distension medium. This standard hypotonic solution contains 27 g sorbitol and 5.4 g mannitol per liter. A pressure of 16 kPa (120 mmHg) was applied to unfold the uterine cavity. Endometrial ablation and dissection of the submucosal myoma were performed within 70 min by monopolar resection. The duration of the procedure was prolonged due to the reduced visibility caused by excessive bleeding and cervical leakage of distension medium, which impeded proper expansion of the uterine cavity. The ventilation pressure increased slowly and continuously 60 min subsequent to the start of surgery. The compliance of the lungs, as well as the achievable minute volume within the acceptable airway pressure limit of 2 kPa, decreased. It was presumed that the level of anaesthesia was insufficient and was followed by the increased administration of propofol (10 mg/kg/h). The additional inhalation of fenoterol did, however, not improve the situation. As ventilation continued to be difficult, the laryngeal mask was replaced by a 7.0 cm (inside diameter) cuffed tube subsequent to the administration of 100 mg succinylcholine as a muscle relaxant. Approximately 50 mL of a foamy, transparent liquid was aspirated from the trachea. Testing with litmus paper indicated an alkaline pH and, therefore, not the aspiration of gastric content. The amount of the pulmonary oedema increased and, despite high levels of peak airway pressures at this point approximately 3 kPa (= set peak pressure limit), adequate ventilation was not possible. Blood gas and electrolyte analyses indicated acidosis, as well as a severe hyponatremia (pH 7.11; Na 74 mEq/L; partial pressure of CO2 49.9 mmHg; saturation of O2 97 % at FiO2 1.0). Cardiopulmonary changes remained minimal. 40 mg of furosemide and 500 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were immediately administered at an infusion rate of 500 mL/h, with constant monitoring for electrolyte changes. As the patient showed clinical signs of impaired haemostasis, the operation procedure was stopped. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with continuous administration of 3 % NaCl at a rate of 50 mL/h and electrolyte control. Plasma sodium levels increased from 74 mEq/L to 103 mEq/L after one hour, and to 130 mEq/L after 7 h (Fig. ). All together 800 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were administered within 7 h totalling at 24 g. Subsequently, sodium replenishment was stopped and the patient was extubated without problems. Immediate neurological assessment revealed no detectable deficits. 20 h after the onset of hyponatremia, the patient’s sodium levels returned to within the normal range. Until then, the cumulative renal excretion was 8.5 L. 9 L of distension medium was used intraoperatively with a calculated uptake of 5 L. The patient was relocated to the gynaecologic ward the following day and was released from the hospital on the third postoperative day without any detectable sequelae.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

Her breathing sounds were clear, and her heartbeat was regular without murmur. A subsequent examination of her lower limbs showed asymmetric bilateral pretibial pitting edema predominantly in the left lower limb. In contrast, the right lower limb was less edematous and had very weak popliteal and pedal pulses. Delayed capillary refilling was also found in the right toes. The Homan's sign was negative.\nSerum laboratory findings at admission were as follows: white blood cell count of 5,300/mm3, hematocrit of 39.5% with hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dl, and platelet count of 286,000/mm3.

The anti-nuclear antibody titer was less than 1:40, the anti-double-stranded DNA titer was 30.9 IU/ml, the C3 level was 158 mg/dl, and the C4 level was 19 mg/dl. Anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin G, anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin M, and lupus anticoagulant were all negative. Urinalysis revealed 3+ proteinuria (spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 10.9 g/g creatinine; spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 7,406.2 mg/g creatinine) and trace hematuria (1-3 red blood cells/high-power field). To investigate the etiology of nephrotic syndrome, an urgent renal biopsy was performed.\nThereafter, although she had no risk factors for thrombosis such as immobilization, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, or a recent orthopedic or gynecologic surgery, to rule out arterial thrombosis of the right lower extremity, lower extremity computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. The CT imaging revealed that the right superficial femoral artery was occluded and there was no identifiable proximal source of thromboembolism in other large arteries (). On the basis of these CT angiographic findings, right lower extremity angiography was performed, which revealed a total occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (). For the treatment of this condition, balloon dilatation was initially tried at the distal superficial femoral artery but failed. Hence, thrombectomy was performed with the Fogarty balloon catheter and the thrombi were successfully aspirated. After the interventional treatment, a good distal arterial flow was reestablished (). Thereafter, warfarin (5 mg/day) as an anticoagulant and corticosteroid treatments were initiated.\nSubsequent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic studies showed no evidence of intracardiac thrombus, vegetation, or other structural abnormalities including patent foramen ovale. Quantitation of proteinuria was confirmed by using a 24-hour urine collection that showed 10.2 g/day of protein excretion and 7.8 g/day of albumin excretion, respectively. Afterwards, with administration of warfarin and corticosteroid, the patient had nearly completely recovered from the edema and claudication and was discharged. The renal pathologic results were consistent with minimal change disease ( and ). Two months after discharge, her urine protein-to-creatinine ratio decreased to less than 0.1 g/g creatinine, her serum albumin level was maintained at 4.1 g/dl, and she had no further symptoms or signs of arterial thrombosis.\n\nWhat is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

Upon physical examination, the patient appeared pale and was noted to have tachycardia, hypotension, and hematochezia. He denied any recent alcohol intake, chest pain, abdominal pain, and abdominal or rectal trauma. Vital signs consisted of a blood pressure of 84/33 mmHg, heart rate of 118 bpm, room air saturation of 92%, and temperature of 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit (37.1 degrees Celsius). He was admitted to the medical ICU for hypovolemic shock secondary to massive bleeding that required immediate endotracheal intubation for airway protection. An initial blood work showed a hemoglobin count of 13.9 g/dL, white blood cell count of 18.7 K/UL, platelet count of 159 K/UL, sodium of 140 mmol/L, potassium of 3.8 mmol/L, chloride of 101 mmol/L, bicarbonate below 10 mmol/L, calcium of 2.2 mmol/L, albumin of 2.7 g/dL, CRP of 233 mg/L, ESR of 36 mm/hr, BUN of 17 mg/dL (6.07 mmol/L), creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL (132.6 Umol/L), lactic acid of 17.0 mmol/L, BNP of 1140.63 pg/ml, total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, troponins of 0.020 ng/mL, and CK-MB of 408 ng/mL. Resuscitation was initiated with administration of isotonic solutions, blood transfusions, and initiation of vasoactive medications, and pantoprazole drip was provided. An initial urgent endoscopy revealed a bleeding Dieulafoy lesion, which was immediately clipped. Acute kidney injury was addressed with aggressive fluid resuscitation as evident by increase in BUN of 33 mg/dL (11.78 mmol/L) and creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL (256.33 Umol/L). CT scan of abdomen performed to rule out ischemic colitis in the setting of progressive abdominal distention showed a diffuse pericolonic inflammation most pronounced at the rectosigmoid colon. Repeat endoscopy showed multiple ulcerated lesions of the gastric mucosa () with a biopsy that revealed necrotic debris with acute leukocytic exudate and numerous variably sized, 90-degree angulated fungal hyphae favoring mucormycosis (). Intravenous liposomal amphotericin-B (5 mg/kg/day at 60 kg weight) was started at a dose of 300 mg daily. Due to deterioration of renal function on the second day, treatment was switched to oral suspension of posaconazole at a dose of 400 mg twice a day for a total of 6 days (of note, no levels of posaconazole were drawn during hospital course). Repeat CT scan of the abdomen showed mild-to-moderate hydroureter with hydronephrosis and bladder wall thickening Figures and . Cystoscopy showed distorted anatomy of bladder lumen with multiple mounds of tissues all throughout the bladder most notable in the trigone with failure to locate ureteral orifices. Random biopsies taken from the bladder tissue also showed necrotic debris with active inflammatory and numerous variably sized angulated fungal hyphae consistent with Mucorales species. Once bladder biopsy confirmed Mucor spp, treatment was switched from posaconazole to intravenous isavuconazonium sulfate at a dose of 372 mg every eight hours for 48 hours as loading dose and then to an oral dose of 372 mg daily. Unfortunately, no sensitivity of the isolate to the newer triazoles was available. Surgical approach was considered; however, given patient's frail state and multiple comorbidities, such approach was deferred. Hydronephrosis significantly improved after placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes. In addition, continuous bladder irrigation with amphotericin-B was given for localized bladder infection for a total of 5 days. A three-way Foley catheter was inserted for continuous amphotericin-B bladder irrigation where 200 ml of medication was administered via catheter; then, the catheter was clamped for 90 minutes and drained to gravity every six hours. After three weeks of systemic treatment with antifungals, a third endoscopy showed only inflammatory changes with a pathologic report, in which mucormycosis was no longer appreciated. His kidney function improved and remained stable after clamping and removal of his nephrostomy tubes. The patient completed 6 months of therapy with 372 mg of oral isavuconazonium sulfate per day. He is currently at home with resolution of his symptoms and no clinical evidence of relapse after 12 months since completion of his treatment.\n\nWhat is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?\n\nAnion Gap: anion_gap = sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L))",

He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.\nInitial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.\nThe etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.\nConcurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

He complained of abdominal pain and inability to move his legs beginning five hours prior to arrival. He awakened from a nap that afternoon and experienced numbness in both legs, which progressed to paralysis. At baseline, he was ambulatory without any history of weakness and was last ambulatory hours prior. He endorsed occasional pain in his legs when walking at baseline.\nHe also complained of abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting for two days. He had a history of alcohol use and reported dark-colored emesis and last bowel movement three days prior. On review of symptoms the patient denied any history of headache, dizziness, chest pain, back pain, trauma, fevers, or extremity weakness. He walked longer than a mile the day prior. History from the patient’s wife revealed that he had an episode of altered level of consciousness while on the couch and that finding combined with his abdominal pain and paralysis prompted her to call 911. The patient’s past medical history was significant for hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and myocardial infarction 10 years prior. His past surgical history included “abdominal stents” and a left carotid stent. His social history was significant for a 25-pack/year history of smoking and daily alcohol. His medications included atenolol and ranitidine.\nPhysical exam showed an oral temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure 107/65mmHg, heart rate 99 beats/minute and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, with oxygen saturation on 15L non-rebreather mask of 94%. His weight was 72.5kg and he appeared older than his stated age. He was alert, cooperative and in moderate distress, primarily complaining of pain and cramping in his lower extremities and repeatedly asking staff to straighten out his legs although they were already lying straight and motionless on the gurney. His head exam was unremarkable with the exception of a dry oropharynx. Cervical spine, cardiac, and lung exams were unremarkable. His abdomen was firm and diffusely tender to palpation with generalized rebound and guarding. An irreducible left inguinal hernia was present. He had vomiting, and placement of a nasogastric tube revealed 1.5 liters of coffee-ground emesis. Lower extremities were thin, cool, and without any palpable or Dopplerable pulses in bilateral femoral, popliteal or pedal distribution. There was trace non-reproducible sensation to the mottled lower extremities, and no sensation distal to the ankles. Motor exam was significant for lower extremity paralysis.\nLaboratory data consisted of sodium 121mEq/L (135–145), potassium 6.8mEq/L (3.3–4.8), chloride 89mEq/L (101–111), CO2 18mEq/L (25–34), BUN 31mg/dL (8–26), creatinine 1.5mg/dL (0.5–1.3), and blood glucose 367mg/dL (70–115).

Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 95 beats/minute with ST elevation inferiorly, anteriorly and laterally (). Bedside ultrasound to evaluate the abdominal aorta was limited. Vascular surgery was consulted prior to CT for concern of a vascular catastrophe. Cardiology was consulted for the patient’s ECG findings consistent with myocardial infarction. The patient went for a non-contrast head CT that was unremarkable and a CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, which was significant for the abdominal aorta with no contrast opacification 2.2cm superior to the bifurcation (), high-grade stenosis of the right common iliac artery, complete occlusion of the left common iliac artery, stents in the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), evidence of occlusion of the proximal SMA and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), hepatic, splenic, bilateral renal infarctions, left inguinal hernia, bowel obstruction, pneumatosis intestinalis with evidence of ischemic bowel, and aspiration in the right lower lung. General surgery was consulted.\nThe cardiology service stated that the patient was not a candidate for cardiac catheterization and to start anticoagulation and low-dose aspirin if there was no contraindication or planned surgery. They also recommended thrombolytics for the diffuse thrombotic disease. The patient did have an echocardiography study that revealed an ejection fraction of 35% and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. General surgery recommended comfort measures as he was not a surgical candidate. Vascular surgery commented that bypass would be futile and if patient survived, would be a candidate for extra-anatomical axillo-bifemoral bypass in the future.

Type 2 DM was diagnosed when he was 31 years old and initially treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents. The patient discontinued oral antidiabetic agents and started insulin therapy 4 years before admission. At that time, he was treated with long-acting insulin glargine and insulin aspart. This insulin regimen was switched to insulin degludec/liraglutide 3 months before admission. While he was on insulin degludec/liraglutide, his home blood glucose monitoring ranged from 110 to 70 mg/dL. Five days before admission, while on insulin degludec/liraglutide in a dose of 18 IU daily, the patient started having recurrent episodes of diaphoresis. During those episodes, usually in the early morning before breakfast, his blood glucose levels were below 50 mg/dL. The patient suffered from several further episodes despite insulin dosage tapering and even after discontinuation. His past medical history was notable for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, acute coronary syndrome, and osteomyelitis of the left foot. His family medical history included atrial fibrillation and DM. In addition to insulin, his therapy consisted in acetylsalicylic acid, bisoprolol, furosemide, ramipril, and atorvastatin. He denied oral antihyperglycemic agents. He had no known drug allergies, he was a former smoker, and he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.\nOn admission, the patient's blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate was 71 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 98%, while he was breathing ambient air. The patient's body mass index was 26.7 kg/m2 (height: 173 cm; weight: 80 kg), and the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory data on admission showed glucose 50 mg/dl, HbA1c 50 mmol/mol, normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, hematocrit 34.8%, and mean corpuscular volume 85 fl), a normal white cell and platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 87 IU/L (normal range: 17–59), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 62 IU/l (normal range: 21–72), gamma glutamyl-transferase 545 IU/l (normal range: 15–73), alkaline phosphatase 177 IU/l (normal range: 38–126), total bilirubin 0.47 mg/dL (normal range: 0.20–1.30), lactate dehydrogenase 1021 IU/L (normal range: 313–618), albumin 3.5 g/dL (normal range: 3.6–5.5), INR 1.18, C-reactive protein 7.5 mg/dl (normal range: 0-1), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 90 mm/h (normal range: 0–15), fibrinogen 621 mg/dl (normal range: 170–410), iron 37 μg/dl (normal range: 49–181), and ferritin 776 ng/ml (normal range: 20–325). Viral markers for hepatitis B and C were negative.\nFurther blood tests were ordered to rule out endogenous hyperinsulinism: C-peptide was 4.2 ng/mL (normal range: 0.5–3), insulin 89 μIU/mL (normal range: 5–25), while the patient's glucose level was 40 mg/dL, and sulfonylurea screening test was negative, confirming endogenous hyperinsulinism. Markers of neuroendocrine tumors were severely increased: chromogranin A (CgA) was 1790 ng/ml (normal range: 0–100), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was 458 ng/ml (normal range: 0–11).\nGiven the high suspicion of insulinoma and the altered liver function tests on admission, a full-body CT scan was ordered. CT scan showed a 4.3 × 2.2 cm pancreatic tail mass containing calcifications with multiple regional lymphadenopathies (). Multiple liver secondary lesions were found: the largest ones measuring 12 and 11 cm, respectively, in II-III and IVb-V segments. No lungs, bone, and brain metastases were detected. Additionally, a thyroid nodule of 2.6 cm was incidentally found. Hepatic metastases were highly suspected to be secondary to a malignant insulinoma, so ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsies of the lesion in the II-III segments were performed (). Histological findings of four core biopsies consisted of hepatocytes infiltrated by a poorly differentiated and focally necrotic proliferating tissue of medium-sized atypical epithelial cells with solid growth pattern (). The cancer cells showed hyperchromatic nuclei with “salt and pepper” chromatin markedly Ki-67 positive, high mitotic index (10 figures × 10 HPF), and scant cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed the neuroendocrine nature and the partial insulin secreting activity of the lesion; CgA, synaptophysin, CD56, and CAM5.2 were diffusely positive; there was patchy (<5%) insulin expression. Ki-67 index was 40–50. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic, poorly differentiated (G3), neuroendocrine carcinoma with morphology and immunophenotype favoring a pancreatic primary tumor. Thyroid ultrasound () showed a weakly hypoechoic solid nodule (2.8 × 3.2 × 1.3 cm) with a central cystic component and regular margins located in the isthmus and a markedly hypoechoic solid nodule (0.9 × 0.9 × 0.6 cm) adjacent to the lower pole of the left lobe. Calcifications and intranodular flow were absent in both nodules, and regional lymph nodes were not enlarged. The results of thyroid function tests were within normal limits (TSH 0.7 mUI/L, normal range: 0.46–4.68), as well as were parathormone (PTH) (80.1 pg/mL, normal range: 13.6–85.8), calcium (8.76 mg/dL, normal range: 8.4–10.2), and phosphorus (4.32 mg/dL, normal range: 2.5–4.5). Serum calcitonin was slightly raised (30 pg/mL, normal range: 0–6), but immunohistochemical staining of the liver lesions was negative for such markers.\nThe patient's hospital stay was characterized by different episodes of severe hypoglycemia (as low as 18 mg/dL) occurring especially at night and in the early morning, manifesting only with diaphoresis. During those episodes, the patient never lost consciousness or developed seizures and even never complained of confusion, amnesia, weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, palpitations, or hunger. In order to reduce the hypoglycemic events, we started a symptomatic treatment with diazoxide and IV infusion of 10% dextrose, while waiting for histopathological confirmation of the disease. Unfortunately, due to the severity of this malignancy, after 8 days of treatment edema, hypotension, oliguria, and weight gain of 10 kg were observed; the patient's clinical status deteriorated rapidly, and 3 days later, the patient died from acute renal failure. Postmortem examination was not carried out according to his family's request.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

The mentioned dose reached 300 mg within 2 weeks. The patient was simultaneously taking 300 mg of bupropion with 20 mg of propranolol and 10 mg of chlordiazepoxide 10 at noon. The patient stated that her appetite would be decreased only in case of taking the three pills simultaneously. During the 8 months, the patient lost 6 kg of weight. Accordingly, after a while, she gradually increased the dose of slow-release bupropion to 450 mg/day due to the persistence of weight. Following such an increase in bupropion dose from 300 mg to 450 mg, after 3 days, she was suffering from painful muscular contractions in the legs, thighs, respiration, and swallowing and also abdominal pain, drooling, and suffocation feeling. She then referred the emergency department and received 10 g of diazepam intramuscularly. However, no change in symptoms made her suspected to be with acute dystonia. To this end, she was treated with 2 mg of biperiden intravenously, and then symptoms were resolved shortly. After 3 days, with the beginning use of 450 mg of bupropion again, the symptoms of acute dystonia begin to recur, which is ameliorated by the injection of biperiden. Two days later, the patient took 300 mg of bupropion again, which also led to acute dystonia symptoms.\nThe patient stated a history of BN disorder since the age of 15, during which she had used different calorie diets, fluoxetine tablets, ritalin tablets, diethylpropion hydrochloride tablets, laxatives, and bisacodyl suppositories as well as the intragastric balloon method. Besides, the patient stated no history of head trauma, convulsions, fever, and drug use. There was also no history of psychiatric disorders and physical diseases in her family.\nNormal complete blood cell counts, calcium and magnesium levels, vitamin B12 levels, folic acid levels, and ferritin levels were reported. The patient's brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also reported normal conditions. Accordingly, following diagnosis of bupropion-induced acute dystonia, the patient was advised to discontinue bupropion intake. In the follow-ups done 2 weeks later, 3 months later, and 6 months later, no signs of acute dystonia was observed.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

After 2 weeks skin petechiae and ecchymoses appeared and the boy was admitted to an Infectious Disease Division. Peripheral blood count showed: hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, platelet 1 × 103/μL, white blood cells 8.5 × 103/μL, neutrophils 87%, lymphocytes 5%. ITP was suspected and intermediate dose methylprednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) was administered for 2 days. CT scan showed multiple masses both in the chest and abdomen, enlarged liver, and hypodense areas in the spleen. On admission to our center, clinical examination revealed obesity (weight 125 kg and height 171 cm), diffuse petechiae all over the skin and ecchymoses on upper and lower limbs. No enlarged peripheral lymph nodes were found. Liver and spleen margins were 2 and 2.5 cm under the lower costal limit, respectively. Laboratory investigation confirmed thrombocytopenia (platelet count 10 × 103/μL) with hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL and white blood cells 13.6 × 103/μL. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate measured 104 mm/h, reactive C protein 17.4 mg/dL (n.v. <0.8), lactate dehydrogenase level 1051 IU/L. Liver function tests including albumin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltransferase, coagulation parameters, and transaminases as well as serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were within the normal range. Viral serology for EBV, hepatitis A, B, and C viruses and HIV as well as autoimmune markers were negative, thus excluding secondary thrombocytopenia. FDG-PET documented high metabolic activity in all the sites evidenced as pathologic by CT scan. Leukemia/lymphoma diagnosis was suspected. Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy revealed normal cellularity with no evidence of neoplastic infiltration and increased megakaryocytes, a picture compatible with ITP. A tru-cut biopsy of one of the abdominal masses was excluded due to adiposity and, consequently, it was decided to perform a laparoscopic procedure. In order to achieve a safe platelet value, a dose of 30 g of IVIG for two consecutive days was administered before surgery. Platelet rose to 30 × 103/μL and two units of platelets were transfused immediately before and during surgery.\nLaparoscopy was complicated by copious bleeding and converted to open surgery. Bleeding was soon controlled with no further complications. Due to the need of respiratory and hemostasis surveillance, the patient was transferred to Intensive Care Unit for 5 days. The platelet count fell to 22 × 103/μL and intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3 days) was administered with a prompt rise of platelet count (204 × 103/μL at day 3). Histological report revealed Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis type (immunophenotypic profile: CD 30+, CD15+/–, CD20–, CD3–, CD43–, LCA–, EMA–, ALK–). Chemotherapy was started according to AIEOP LH 2004 protocol, which includes 6 COPP/ABV cycles (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone/adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine) followed by involved field radiotherapy. Platelet count showed an asymptomatic second fall to 75 × 103/μL during the first course and rose up to normal values without the need of additional treatments. The boy is now in complete remission, with a normal platelet count, 13 months after the end of treatment (Fig.).\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

            "input": "We present a report of a 42-year-old woman of African descent who presented to our fertility clinic with a 10-year history of primary subfertility and amenorrhea of 6 years duration. She was a nurse in a medical ward and had no prior history of TB. She was separated from her husband and intended to use donated sperm for her assisted conception treatment. The timeline of interventions is summarized in Table below.\nThe initial evaluation for subfertility (in a different institution) included a diagnostic laparoscopy performed 8 years prior. The laparoscopy had revealed dense pelvic adhesions (“a frozen pelvis”), and an impression of tubal factor subfertility was made. It appears that there was no deliberate attempt to make a definitive diagnosis as to the cause of the tubal disease as no tissue samples or swabs were assessed. She had undergone a pelvic ultrasound scan which was reported as normal and had had a negative pap smear. There were neither further details of this prior evaluation nor a detailed summary from her previous gynecologist.\nShe neither had a history of pelvic pain nor a history suggestive of previous sexually transmitted infections. She did not report any symptoms suggestive of TB, notably fever, night sweats, or weight loss. She weighed 84 kg, was 1.58 meters tall with a body mass index (BMI) of 33. Her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg and her clinical examination was essentially normal. She had no lymphadenopathy, acne, or hirsutism. Her gonadal hormone profile presented in Table was in keeping with PCOS.\nThe initial high estradiol (E2) levels and the biochemical evidence of PCOS prompted the use of an exogenous progestogen to initiate endometrial shedding prior to baseline ultrasound scan in preparation for an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle. She received medroxyprogesterone (Provera) 10 mg orally once a day for 5 days but had no withdrawal bleed. Two weeks after administration of medroxyprogesterone, she still reported no withdrawal bleed. A subsequent pelvic ultrasound scan showed normal uterine morphology. Her endometrial thickness was 3 mm with a small amount of endometrial fluid with no focal endometrial pathology demonstrable on ultrasound. Her ovaries had a polycystic appearance with multiple small peripheral follicles. A simple cyst of 4 cm in size was visualized in her right ovary. The ultrasound findings further supported the diagnosis of PCOS.\nEndometrial assessment by hysteroscopy was undertaken in view of the presence of endometrial fluid and the negative progesterone challenge test. Hysteroscopy revealed an atrophic endometrium interspersed with areas of thickened endometrium, with no synechiae, and bilaterally obliterated and poorly visualized tubal ostia. Directed endometrial biopsies were taken. Histology showed endometrial tissue with a normal gland to stromal ratio. Numerous granulomas, with epithelioid histiocytes, plasma cells and Langhans giant cells were visualized in the stroma with some areas of necrosis. A Ziehl–Neelsen stain was negative. A conclusion of granulomatous endometritis possibly TB endometritis was made.\nFollowing the diagnosis of TB, further investigations were carried out. A chest X-ray was normal and an HIV test was negative. Her liver function tests, creatinine, and full blood count were all normal. She was referred to a physician for TB treatment and plans for assisted reproductive technology (ART) were deferred. Treatment for TB endometritis was started by use of a 6-month regimen of antitubercular therapy. An initial 2-month intensive phase of four drugs (rifampicin 600 mg once daily, isoniazid 300 mg once daily, pyrazinamide 2000 mg once daily, and ethambutol 1600 mg once daily) was followed by a 4-month course of two drugs (rifampicin 600 mg once daily, isoniazid 300 mg once daily). In addition, a daily dose of pyridoxine 25 mg was administered throughout the 6 months. Antihypertensive treatment was initiated in the second month of antitubercular treatment. She was evaluated after a week of initiation of TB therapy and thereafter every month by the physician. She was compliant on all her medications and experienced no adverse effects. She reported no menses despite completing the TB treatment. The supervising TB physician did not consider it clinically relevant to re-biopsy after a full course of TB therapy.\nShe maintained her desire for conception and revisited the fertility clinic. A follow-up ultrasound scan showed less evident endometrial fluid compared to the initial pelvic ultrasound scan with an endometrial thickness of 3.7 mm. Her ovaries were still polycystic but the 4 cm right ovarian cyst was no longer present. A decision on a second trial of endometrial stimulation/shedding was made. She received one cycle of low-dose combined oral contraceptive pills but reported no menses. There was no change in endometrial findings on follow-up scan.\nA conclusion of endometrial scarring post-endometrial TB was made. Further attempts at endometrial stimulation were discouraged in view of her very high endogenous E2 and complete failure of response to exogenous steroids. The options of surrogacy or adoption were discussed while further ART interventions were discouraged due to the endometrial damage.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?\n\nMaintenance Fluids Calculations: maintenance_fluid = base_value + weight_coefficient * weight, where base_value is 60 ml/hr for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 40 ml/hr for patients with a weight between 10kg and 20kg, and 0 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg, and weight_coefficient is 1 for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 2 for patients  with a weight between between 10kg and 20kg, and 4 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg",

            "input": "A 76-year-old woman presented at our outpatient clinic with symptomatic OA of the right knee. At admission her height was measured to be 139.8 cm and her weight was measured to be 46.5 kg. Her past medical history included NF, congenital pseudarthrosis, and combined deformities of the tibia and fibula that resulted in the shortening of the right lower limb. At presentation, her examination revealed a limited active range of motion at the right knee joint (from 0 to 90°), a valgus deformity of 14° using the femoro-tibial angle measurement, severe pain, and a progressively worsening antalgic gait due to the preexisting limb shortening. These deformities, including pseudoarthrosis, are consistent with skeletal deformities previously described in patients diagnosed with NF. She was diagnosed with Grade 4 OA as per the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification based on the results of radiographic imaging and the physical examination (). Her walking distance was limited due to pain. Passive range of motion studies revealed significant hyperextension (−10°) consistent with an increased risk for dislocation. The physical exam also revealed peroneal nerve palsy and café au-lait spots across her entire body, the latter finding indicative of advanced NF. She had previously undergone a bone transplant at the fibula with a graft taken from the tibia approximately 50 years prior; as such, there was only a limited amount of viable bone remaining to support the successful implantation of a prosthesis. As there was not sufficient viable bone stock available to support the ready-made intramedullary stem used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA; ), our initial plan was to perform a bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (BKA). Furthermore, as part of the preoperative procedure at our hospital, we conducted a bone density test. This evaluation revealed a femoral bone density of 0.525 g/cm3, which affirmed our decision to avoid a TKA, as the quality of the available bone stock would unlikely be sufficient to support adequate fixation of the larger implants required in this procedure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed to provide maximum visualization of the lesion, given the discrepancies in the anatomical structures and also to evaluate the soft tissue condition (). Although a bicompartmental knee implant was templated, the cartilage on the medial side of the joint was found to be intact on the coronal MRI scan, thereby presenting a contraindication to this procedure (). Additional radiographic studies revealed that the patient had both femoral and tibial insufficiency and a significant reduction in the bone stock available for the positioning of an implant that required a tibial stem. As this patient also exhibited problems with osteogenesis due to NF, all procedures were planned with the goal of limiting the degree of tissue damage. With this in mind, we considered unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) as a minimally invasive procedure that might be used for the successful amelioration of her OA symptoms. A lateral UKA to fix the valgus deformity was discussed with the patient as a means to provide adequate relief from the pain resulting from the bone-on-bone contact at the lateral side as well as to address the problem of hyperextension. The patient agreed to this course of action. Preoperative planning focused on addressing the issues associated with bone-on-bone contact as well as repair of the valgus deformity with the goal of promoting stability at the knee. The range of motion was verified preoperatively, and femoral and tibial contact points were mapped across the full range of motion to determine the degree of the anterior slope. Unfortunately, the dimensions of the anterior slope precluded the use of an implant of the size that would be desirable given the patient’s tibial dimensions. We were also aware of the fact that the risks of dislocation are increased in NF patients due to characteristic joint hypermobility and problems with soft tissue in areas such as the skin, menisci, and musculature.\nDuring surgery, the surrounding tissue was debrided, and a large fragment of debris was removed from the joint space. Visual inspection of the knee confirmed the diagnosis of isolated lateral OA with intact medial articulation (). A femoral unicompartmental knee system (Physica ZUK; size D) implant and a 29 mm × 50 mm tibial implant (Zimmer®) were inserted. Perioperative radiographs revealed that, although the trial implant was slightly larger than ideal, synchronous soft tissue balance of the knee was confirmed (). Unfortunately, as customized implants were not available, space remained between the femoral implant and the femoral condyle.\nPrior to final fixation, the articulation site was copiously irrigated to facilitate the penetration of cement into the femur and tibia. The final implant was then inserted into small holes that were drilled into the tibia and femur that also facilitated cement adhesion. The cement was molded to fill the gap observed during the trial implantation ().\nPostoperative imaging and physical examination revealed that the anterior tibial slope was repaired and that the valgus deformity was reduced to 5° from the 14° determined preoperatively (). The patient was capable of ambulation within 24 hours after completion of the procedure. However, the patient developed a varus thrust and continued to require epidural analgesia for 48 hours after the procedure. The rehabilitation plan included assisted range of motion and partial weight-bearing walking exercises. The patient exhibited a myopathic gait; this was deemed acceptable given her preexisting musculoskeletal condition. One week after the procedure, the patient continued to ambulate with the assistance of two walking poles and a knee brace. She reported that soreness developed after walking for approximately 20 meters; this was attributed to preoperative muscle stiffness (). The active range of motion extended from 0 to 110°; this represented a significant improvement over her preoperative range of 0 to 90°. Ankle movement was restricted due to preexisting peroneal nerve palsy and mild pain was present after the surgery. The most substantial functional gains from the lateral UKA procedure were the improvements in the knee alignment and the reduction in the valgus deformity. Both of these corrections contributed to significant improvements in patient ambulation.\nTwo weeks after the procedure, the patient experienced a fall that resulted in a stress fracture of the tibial plateau. The lesion was diagnosed as a proximal oblique fracture of the tibia. This was most likely due to a mismatch between the implant and patient-specific mechano-physiology which may have potentially resulted in sagittal overcutting. The tibial UKA component was not displaced (). Three days post-fracture, a surgical procedure involving a locking plate was planned. A distal tibia anterolateral plate (A.L.P.S®) with nine holes was rotated upside down to achieve successful fixation of the fracture. Eight locking cortical screws were inserted; postoperative imaging documented adequate fixation and support (). Given the high risk for dislocations, continuous passive motion therapy was contraindicated. Within five days after the second procedure, the patient reported only minimal pain and was able to undergo successful rehabilitation to improve her range of motion. We note that her participation in the standard rehabilitation program was interrupted due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was unfortunate, as adequate postoperative rehabilitation can be critical for recovery. The patient was provided with a fixed knee brace to stabilize her leg during the first two months after the insertion of the locking plate. As the COVID-19 pandemic was then under adequate control in the region, the patient was able to follow a rehabilitation plan that included both passive and active progressive range of motion exercises, partial weight-bearing walking regimens, and measures designed to manage pain and swelling. The patient was put on a partial weight-bearing walking regimen (30% to start, gradually increased to 100% body weight every week) beginning at one week postoperatively. At the two-month postoperative checkup, the patient was able to walk with a full weight load without assistance (). Four months after the procedure, the patient reported significant improvements with respect to pain and active range of motion. The patient returned to her activities of daily life and did not need a knee brace or supporter (). Radiographic images revealed callus formation at the fracture site, indicative of new bone formation. We planned to follow this patient on a more long-term basis to manage pain and swelling and to maintain the improved range of motion and weight-bearing capability. However, the overall impact of COVID-19 limited the extent to which we could follow this patient after the five-month check-up. Nonetheless, the patient planned to continue with the prescribed rehabilitation plan. The patient presented for a 7-month postoperative checkup and reported some residual pain that she managed effectively with the pain medication regimen that was prescribed. She reported that she was able to walk on most days and carry out day-to-day activities without difficulty. On certain days, she noted some instability at her knee joint which is likely attributable to the postoperative fracture. Further radiographic studies revealed appropriate fracture healing, and her physical exam documented appropriate knee alignment.\nAlthough the patient was capable of ambulation prior to the UKA procedure, she relied on external support and experienced substantial pain due to osteoarthritis and poor knee alignment. The contraindications to a conventional TKA outweighed the possible benefits that might be achieved in this case. A UKA seemed to be a more appropriate solution toward resolving the pain resulting from bone-on-bone contact and the valgus deformity. The UKA procedure is less invasive, maintains the kinematics at the knee, preserves more bone, and facilitates easier revision surgery if this becomes necessary.\nThe decision to perform a UKA was controversial due to the unique complexities associated with this patient. However, these therapeutic modalities resulted in a significant improvement in the patient’s quality of life. This outcome was evaluated quantitatively by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) which is included in the (). An increase of 8–10 points on the KOOS total score has been clearly established as a clinically significant improvement. Our patient exhibited a 23.2-point increase in KOOS in response to treatment. This finding indicates that the patient experienced significant benefit from the complete treatment plan. Specifically, the patient reported improvements in areas including but not limited to, a reduction in pain, reduced stiffness, improved mobility, and a better quality of life.\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².\n\nBody Mass Index (BMI): bmi = (weight (in kg))/(height (in m) * height (in m))",

She had taken only the prescribed acetaminophen one day before. According to her past medical history, she went to kindergarten, had not traveled recently, had no history of pancreatitis, autoimmune disease, choledochal cyst, or pancreatic ductal abnormalities, and her family history was negative for pancreatic disease. She has one older sister, and her sister did not have symptoms such as fever. Her vital signs at admission were as follows: blood pressure, 97/60 mmHg; heart rate, 104 beats/min; respiration rate, 24 breaths/min; and body temperature, 37.4℃. Her height was 98 cm (50th–75th percentile), and her weight was 15 kg (50th–75th percentile). On physical examination, multiple vesicles on the soft palate and maculopapular rashes were observed on both the hands and feet. She had a clear breathing sound, regular heartbeat without murmur, and soft abdomen with a normoactive bowel sound without an abdominal mass or abdominal tenderness. In initial laboratory studies, the serum glucose was decreased (41 mg/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate was slightly increased (17 mm/hr; reference range, 0–10 mm/hr), and C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (12.9 mg/L; reference range, 0.0–5.0 mg/L), and other laboratory studies were within the normal ranges. The white blood cell count was 7.8×103/µL, hemoglobin was 12.6 g/dL, platelet count was 252×103/µL, blood urea nitrogen was 15.0 mg/dL, creatinine was 0.42 mg/dL, cholesterol was 187 mg/dL, albumin was 4.3 g/dL, total bilirubin was 0.39 mg/dL, direct bilirubin was 0.11 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase was 34 IU/L, alanine aminotransaminase was 10 IU/L, sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 4.4 mmol/L. Amylase and lipase tests were not performed at the time of admission. Urine ketone body was 3 positive in urinalysis. A chest X-ray showed no active lung lesions, cardiopulmonary angle blunting, or cardiomegaly. Abdomen X-rays showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern without ileus or pancreatic calcification.\nWe treated the child conservatively with intravenous fluid. On the first hospital day (HD), her fever subsided. On the third HD, she complained of ear pain caused by acute otitis media and intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanate was administered at a dose of 90 mg/kg/day. On the fourth HD, she experienced severe epigastric pain and vomiting. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 107/80 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min.; respiration rate, 24 breaths/min; and body temperature, 37.2℃. On physical examination, she complained of epigastric tenderness. The serum levels of amylase and lipase were remarkably elevated (amylase, 1,902 IU/L; reference range, 28–100 IU/L; lipase, >1,500 IU/L; reference range, 13–60 IU/L). Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed mild diffuse swelling of the pancreas from head to tail with a small amount of ascites (), which suggested acute pancreatitis.\nConsidering the patient's history of HFMD, we thought that enterovirus, which is a common cause of HFMD, could be a pathogen. We asked the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for enterovirus typing of her stool sample. In the first step, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on the specimens targeting the 5' noncoding region capable of detecting all 68 serotypes, and the result was enterovirus-positive. In the second step, 2-step RT-PCR was performed targeting viral protein 1, which has a different structural enterovirus protein for each subtype, and CA16 was detected in the sample.\nAfter acute pancreatitis was diagnosed, the patient was fasted and given sufficient intravenous fluid. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were given for pain control. Serum amylase and lipase were serially followed (). The fever, epigastric pain, and vomiting were recovered on the sixth HD. She was discharged on the 11th HD without pancreatitis-related complications. On the day of discharge, the serum levels of amylase and lipase were remarkably reduced (amylase, 289 IU/L; lipase, 893 IU/L).\nShe was followed up after discharge without any symptoms, and pancreatitis has not recurred yet.

He had no urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms. He had his most recent BCG instillation done the day before the index presentation. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 102.8 F, pulse rate of 92/min, respiratory rate of 40/min and blood pressure 78/45 mmHg with oxygen saturation of 93% on ambient air. On physical examination, he appeared toxic, dehydrated and in respiratory distress. Chest examination revealed asymmetric chest expansion with dullness to percussion, decreased tactile fremitus on the left side with reduced air entry on auscultation. The cardiovascular examination was however unremarkable.\nComplete blood count revealed marked leukocytosis with a white cell count of 27,200/microliter (Normal 4,800–12,000/microliter) and hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL (Normal 14.0–17.5 g/dL). Lactate was markedly elevated at 7.8 meq/L (Normal 0.6–1.4 meq/L) and arterial blood gas revealed high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Basic metabolic panel revealed creatinine of 2.31 mg/dL from normal baseline (Normal 0.6–1.3 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen of 28 mg/dL (Normal 7–25 mg/dL). Sputum culture with gram stain showed normal oral flora. Urinary streptococcal and legionella antigens were negative. Chest X-ray on admission revealed left basilar pneumonia with small left pleural effusion. CT head showed no acute intracranial abnormalities. The preliminary blood culture result was negative for any micro-organisms.\nDue to altered mental status with increased work of breathing and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, patient was intubated and placed on ventilation in the medical intensive care unit. He was commenced on vasopressors and intravenous Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for septic shock thought to be secondary to community-acquired pneumonia and possible urinary tract infection. Despite the completion of several courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, he continued to have low-grade pyrexia and failed to improve clinically. Suspicion for rarer etiologies such as systemic BCG dissemination began to grow and blood cultures for acid-fast bacilli initially obtained on admission returned positive for acid-fast bacilli, specifically Mycobacteria bovis in the two sets of samples thus confirming our suspicion. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were immediately discontinued, and he was commenced on triple therapy with Isoniazid 300 mg daily, Ethambutol 1600 mg daily and Rifampicin 30 mg daily. He improved clinically and was discharged 5 days later to complete 2 months of triple therapy with Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Ethambutol followed by 4 months of maintenance therapy with Rifampicin and Isoniazid.

When the emergency medical services team arrived on scene, the patient was found down on the floor with right leg weakness; he was confused and aphasic. No fumes or smoke was evident. His initial laboratory investigation at a local hospital showed potassium 6.1 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 26 mg/dL, creatinine 2.3 mg/dL, D-dimer 2240 µg/L, lactic acid 15 mmol/L, and glucose 166 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis disclosed pH 6.60, PCO2 50 mm Hg, Po2 176 mm Hg, and HCO3 4.9 mEq/L on a Fio2 100%. Due to altered mental status, he was intubated and was subsequently transferred to our medical facility. On route, for the treatment of hyperkalemia, he was given 3 ampoules of sodium bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, kayexalate, and insulin with dextrose water.\nSix hours after the incident, the patient was more alert and oriented and his leg pain had subsided. Details of smoking history could not be obtained due to the intubation. On physical examination, temperature was 35.8°C, heart rate 107 bpm, blood pressure 137/94 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 14 breaths/minute. He had regular heart rhythm, no murmur or pericardial rub. His abdomen was soft with active bowel sound. There were no symptoms and signs of limb ischemia on admission. He had no leg pain, pallor, poikilothermia, pulselessness, paresthesia, or paralysis. Motor power was at least grade 4 in all 4 extremities. His dorsalis pedis pulse was 2+ bilaterally. Initial investigations at our medical facility showed white blood cell 11400/µL, neutrophils 89%, hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit 38.6%, platelet 159000/µL, blood urea nitrogen 29 mg/dL, creatinine 2.0 mg/dL, sodium 142 mEq/L, potassium 3.9 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 19 mEq/L, lactic acid 4.25 mmol/L, troponin T 0.1 ng/mL, and negative for acetone. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and no ST-T change. The liver function test demonstrated aspartate aminotransferase 1697 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 1263 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 138 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, total protein 6.2 gm/dL, and albumin 3.5 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed white blood cell 5 to 10/high-power field, red blood cell 0 to 3/high-power field, moderate blood but negative for urine myoglobin. Coagulogram showed prothrombin time 17.5 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 25.8 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.59. Calculated fractional excretion of sodium and urea were 2.11% and 43.67%, respectively, consistent with acute tubular necrosis. The viral hepatitis panel was negative except for a positive AntiHBc IgG antibody. Arterial blood gas analysis on admission depicted pH 7.319, PO2 130.3 mm Hg, PCO2 40.8 mm Hg, HCO3 20.5 mEq/L, and Sao2 100%, carboxyhemoglobin 0.2%, and methemoglobin 0.1% while on assist-control mode of mechanical ventilation with Fio\n2 100%. Computed tomography of head was performed and showed chronic right basal ganglion infarct. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and showed severely depressed left ventricular function with ejection fraction of less than 20%, grade II/IV diastolic dysfunction with mild TR, mild MR, and mild PR. Akinesis of the septal wall and hypokinesis of the anterolateral wall were present. Moreover, computed tomography of abdomen, pelvis, and chest without contrast revealed right lower lung consolidation with small right pleural effusion, moderately bilateral nonspecific perinephric fat stranding, submucosal fatty infiltration, and mild wall thickening of the descending colon down to the rectum. Subtle perirectal fat stranding was also visualized. Initially, he was treated with empiric antibiotics for possible pneumonia with severe sepsis with piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. Aspirin and full-dose enoxaparin were started to cover possible acute coronary syndrome. Surgery was consulted due to a concern of bowel ischemia. Proctoscopy was done and showed normal pink rectal mucosa without blood in the vault. Because the patient was hemodynamically stable, had no abdominal pain, and lactic acid level had returned to normal, the surgery service recommended continued fluid replacement for volume expansion.\nHis lactate levels decreased spontaneously from 15 mmol/L to 3.39, 2.52, and 1.28 mmol/L at 0, 10, 14, and 33 hours, respectively, after his initial symptoms, along with an improvement of arterial pH and anion gap (). After 24 hours of admission, he improved dramatically and was extubated on day 2 of admission. Five hours after extubation (42 hours after admission), he started to have left leg pain. His left leg turned bluish and became paler with prominent livedo reticularis throughout his left leg (). Therefore, a heparin drip was initiated promptly and vascular surgery was consulted. Soon after that, the patient developed sudden cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity. He had return of spontaneous circulation after 15 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. At that moment, his lactate level rebounded to 8.13 mmol/L. To rule out acute aortic dissection and acute massive pulmonary embolism as well as acute left limb gangrene from embolism, computed tomography of pulmonary artery with contrast and computed tomography angiogram of aorta were performed. He had no pulmonary emboli or abdominal aortic dissection. He did have high-grade stenosis of the infrarenal abdominal aorta just above the bifurcation, near total occlusion of the right common iliac artery, severe luminal narrowing of the left common iliac artery, bilateral external iliac arteries, and bilateral common femoral arteries by calcified and noncalcified plaques ( and ).

An airway examination on the day of surgery showed a prominent mandible, limited mouth opening, macroglossia, positive prognathism, Mallampati IV classification, and thyromental distance (thyroid notch to the tip of the jaw with the head extended) >6 cm; a thyromental distance <6 cm serves as a predictor for difficult intubation. He also had other distinct skeletal features that included prominent supraciliary arches and nose bridge, as well as large hands and feet.\nFollowing induction of general anesthesia with lidocaine, fentanyl, and propofol and muscle relaxation with succinylcholine, an elective Airtraq device was used for intubation with moderate difficulty. Following a second attempt, a 7.0 endotracheal tube was passed blindly into his trachea because of large immobile epiglottis that resulted in a grade IV indirect view. His surgical procedure was uneventful and he was extubated without difficulty. After full recovery in the post-anesthesia recovery unit, he was informed that he had a difficult airway and advised to inform all future anesthesia providers. In addition, because of the high index of suspicion for acromegaly he was educated about the possibility of having this disorder and was advised to follow up with his primary care provider for further evaluation.\nEndocrine tests performed subsequently included serum cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, hemoglobin A1C, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), GH, and parathyroid hormone levels. All of his biochemical markers were normal except for his serum IGF-1 and GH (Table ) that were 700 ng/ml and 22.5 ng/ml, respectively: twofold greater than the reference normal upper limit. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic left ventricular function. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain showed a large mass arising from the sella and extending into the suprasellar cistern (19 × 12 × 20 mm), consistent with pituitary macroadenoma (Fig. ).\nA neurosurgical evaluation was performed and he underwent a transsphenoidal resection of his pituitary tumor 3 months later.

The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?\n\nDelta Gap: delta_gap = anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12",

            "input": "A 21-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to a hospital (collaborating institution) in Southern Germany in late summer with newly manifested jaundice as well as a seven-day-history of myalgia, retro-orbital headaches, fatigue, recurrent fever, and nausea. Since the beginning of his illness, myalgia — especially in the calf region — intensified, causing the patient an increasing difficulty in walking. He reported an episode of gum bleeding after cleaning his teeth. There was no history of traveling abroad in the last months and no recent contact with animals. Two weeks prior to the onset of his symptoms the patient sustained a minor knee injury resulting in a skin abrasion while bathing in the river Isar close to Munich, Germany.\nThe patient works as a computer scientist and has no relevant medical history. Weight and height upon admission were recorded to be 90 kg and 189 cm, respectively (BMI = 25.2 kg/m2). Alcohol, nicotine, or drug anamnesis was negative. No medication or allergies were reported.\nOn examination, the patient appeared tired, but he displayed no neurological abnormalities. Body temperature was 36.8 °C, pulse 90 bpm, blood pressure 114/75 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 bpm, and oxygen saturation 99% while breathing ambient air. The lungs and heart auscultation was unremarkable, the abdomen was soft and non-tender. The skin and scleral inspection revealed jaundice and a slight gum bleeding was observed during the examination of the oral cavity. Upon pressure, tenderness in the thighs and calves was reported.\nAbdominal ultrasound upon admission to the hospital revealed hepatosplenomegaly and no signs of intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. White-cell count was 9.9 G/L (87% neutrophils and 3.5% lymphocytes), platelet count 39 G/L, and hemoglobin 13.3 g/dl. Serum sodium level was 123 mmol/l, potassium 3.15 mmol/l, and creatinine 2.8 mg/dl (248 μmol/l) with glomerular filtration rate of 31 ml/min/1.73m2. C-reactive protein was 15.4 mg/dl, procalcitonin 2.86 ng/ml, and interleukin-6 was 66.4 pg/ml. Aspartate aminotransferase was 92 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 65 U/l, total bilirubin 17.3 mg/dl (with direct bilirubin reaching 14.7 mg/dl), gamma-glutamyltransferase 47 U/l and alkaline phosphatase 108 U/l. Creatine kinase was 1197 U/l, prothrombin time international normalized ratio 1.2, and partial-thromboplastin time 33 s. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 8, 3+ protein (6.3 g protein/12 h), 5–10 leukocytes per high power field, and 0–2 erythrocytes per high power field. An overview of laboratory test results with the corresponding reference ranges is shown in Table .\nOn day 1 upon admission an empiric intravenous antimicrobial regime with doxycycline (100 mg every 24 h) and ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 h) was initiated while a selection of tests in search for microbial and viral agents was pending. The patient received intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement. Within 48 h upon admission, hypokalemia (2.32 mmol/l) and hyponatremia (113 mmol/l) worsened significantly without signs of acid-base dysregulation in blood gas analysis. Creatinine increased to 4.37 mg/dl (386 μmol/l), and a polyuria with up to 7.2 L urine output /24 h was documented. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the initial collaborating institution and — approximately 48 h later — transferred to the ICU at our university hospital. Starting from day 4 since the initial admission creatinine levels started to decrease, polyuria was in regress and potassium and sodium levels normalized. In addition, platelet count improved and C-reactive protein decreased. The patient remained afebrile. Despite the gradually improving general condition of the patient, serum bilirubin levels were constantly rising starting from day 1 since admission, reaching its maximum on day 4 (54 mg/dl total bilirubin, 39 mg/dl direct bilirubin). Aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase remained normal or mildly elevated (Table ).\nUrine and blood cultures revealed no growth. Screening tests for hepatotropic viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, and E) as well as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus were negative. Elevated IgG antibodies to herpes simplex virus (HSV 1 and 2) were detected while IgM antibodies remained within the normal range, suggesting an earlier or latent infection with HSV virus. Quantitative serology assays for hantavirus, Chlamydia, Brucella, and Rickettsia (rickettsii/conorii) showed no evidence for infection with these pathogens. Urine test for Legionella antigen was negative. Within normal range were: antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibodies type 1 (anti-LKM-1), anti-soluble liver antigen antibody/liver-pancreas (a-SLA/LP), anti-liver membrane antibodies (LMA), anti-liver specific protein antibodies (LSP), and perinuclear- and cytoplasmic-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA and c-ANCA) whereby autoimmune hepatitis could be ruled out. Normal levels of serum copper (110 μg/dl, reference range: 70–140 μg/dl) as well as serum ceruloplasmin (0.44 g/l, reference range: 0.2–0.6 g/l) allowed to dismiss Wilson’s disease from diagnostic consideration.\nThe presumptive diagnosis of icteric leptospirosis was strengthened by detection of antileptospiral IgM antibodies with the use of ELISA in the acute phase serum specimen (38 U/ml, reference range: < 15 U/ml, SERION ELISA classic Leptospira IgG/IgM, Virion Serion, Würzburg, Germany) and confirmed by an accredited PCR method using proprietary primers at the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene at the University of Regensburg, Germany. The therapy with doxycycline was discontinued (total duration of 3 days) and the regime with ceftriaxone carried on as a targeted monotherapy (total duration of 12 days).\nThe patient was discharged home after a total of 12 days of hospitalization (3 days at the ICU). The general condition upon discharge was reported as good; fatigue was declining and the remaining symptoms, with the exception of jaundice (total bilirubin 6.2 mg/dl), subsided.\nThroughout hospitalization and a 3-month follow-up period, indocyanine green plasma disappearance rates were recorded multiple times. For each measurement, 25 mg of the ICG dye were dissolved in 5 ml of distilled water, and a dose of 22.5 mg (0.25 mg/kg body weight) was injected intravenously. ICG-PDR was determined via non-invasive, transcutaneous pulse dye densitometry with the use of the LiMON device (Pulsion Medical Systems SE, Feldkirchen, Germany). Initial concentration at time “0” was set to be 100% and plasma disappearance rate was calculated as percentage change over time (%/min) []. Normal values for ICG-PDR are considered to be 18–25%/min [, ]. The measured ICG-PDR values, total bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase serum levels are displayed in Fig. .\nInitially severely reduced ICG-PDR (2%/min on day 5 upon initial admission) gradually improved within several days to reach almost normal level on day 10 upon initial admission to hospital (17.4%/min). Approximately 7 weeks after initial hospitalization, ICG-PDR was recorded to be within normal range (23.7%/min) and reached 33.4%/min on day 85. While ICG-PDR values rapidly normalized in parallel with clinical improvement, serum bilirubin levels were slowly decreasing (44.4 mg/dl on day 5 and 9.0 mg/dl on day 10 upon hospitalization), and it was only until 7 weeks upon admission that they reached normal levels (Fig. ). Mild elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase was at its peak of 124 U/l on day 12 upon hospitalization (Table ) and reached close to normal levels by week 7 upon admission (Fig. and Additional file ). Within the 3-month follow-up period, fatigue resolved and the patient reported no remaining symptoms.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

There were no medical events or endocrine diseases in his own or familial medical history. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case.\nPhysical examination revealed a plethoric moon-shaped face and central obesity, without purple striae or a buffalo hump. The blood pressure was 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient’s height, body weight, and waist circumference were 187 cm, 90 kg, and 104 cm, respectively (body mass index 25.74 kg/m2).\nThe results of routine laboratory tests including liver and kidney function tests were normal. The fasting plasma glucose level of 6.5 mmol/L [reference interval (RI): 3.7–5.6 mmol/L] and glycosylated hemoglobin level of 44 mmol/mol (RI: 20–42 mmol/mol) were consistent with new-onset impaired fasting glucose. A sodium level of 146 mmol/L (RI: 136–145 mmol/L) and potassium level of 3.5 mmol/L (RI: 3.4–4.5 mmol/L) suggested increased mineralocorticoid activity.\nAfter exclusion of exogenous steroids, first-line screening tests for suspected endogenous hypercortisolism were performed. The 24 hours urinary free cortisol excretion level was elevated (6.465–5.375 nmol/24 hours; RI: 16–168 nmol/24 hours), the salivary cortisol rhythm was impaired (late-night salivary cortisol level of 55–46 nmol/L; RI: 0.5–2.6 nmol/L), and serum cortisol level was not suppressed after administration of 1 mg dexamethasone (cortisol 444 nmol/L). These results confirmed a diagnosis of endogenous CS. ACTH levels were increased (14.1 pmol/L; RI: 2.2–11 pmol/L), indicating ACTH-dependent CS.\nOver the next few weeks, hypokalemia was observed along with increased blood pressure levels. Therefore, we initiated medical therapy with potassium canrenoate and metyrapone, which achieved rapid control of blood pressure and potassium levels.\nTo identify the source of ACTH secretion, the patient underwent all second-line dynamic tests for ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism.\nAfter the human CRH test (100 μg), there was a significant increase in both ACTH level (15.2 to 50.6 pmol/L, +233.3%) and cortisol level (763 to 1.631 nmol/L, +113.8%). There was also a significant increase in both ACTH level (16.8 to 27.7 pg/mL, +64.7%) and cortisol level (778 to 1,032 nmol/L, +32%) during the DDAVP test. These results suggested pituitary ACTH secretion (). However, no cortisol suppression was found after the HDDST (8 mg overnight, cortisol level 778 to 690 nmol/L, −11.3%).\nPituitary MRI revealed a 4-mm pituitary microadenoma; however, the clinical features, in particular the rapid onset of severe hypertension and hypokalemia, combined with reduced cortisol suppression after the HDDST, suggested EAS. Therefore, the patient underwent chest CT and abdominal enhanced MRI, which showed multiple pancreatic nodules; their neuroendocrine origin was suggested by the uptake of 68-Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT, confirming the presence of somatostatin receptors.\nConsidering the discordant responses to second-line dynamic tests and evidence of both pituitary and pancreatic lesions, we decided to perform BIPSS to facilitate the differential diagnosis between CD and EAS. The central IPS to peripheral (P) ACTH ratio (IPS:P =25) after CRH administration confirmed the pituitary origin of ACTH secretion.\nBased on the clinical presentation (pituitary adenoma and pancreatic nodules in a young patient), we performed Sanger sequencing for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), which confirmed a pathogenic variant in the menin gene (base pair insertions c.188_189TT cDNA692_693_inTT Q64Sfs56, loss of frameshift).\nThe patient underwent pituitary surgery, and histological examination confirmed a pituitary adenoma with positive ACTH staining. After surgery, low levels of morning serum cortisol confirmed the remission of CD, requiring replacement therapy. On physical examination, we observed reduction in body weight and facial plethora; moreover, the patient’s blood pressure normalized without antihypertensive treatment.\nA few months after the pituitary surgery, the patient underwent abdominal surgery (duodeno-cephalo-pancreatectomy and distal pancreatectomy). The histology report revealed well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and focal nesidioblastosis; immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and glucagon, and negative staining for ACTH, serotonin, somatostatin, gastrin, insulin, and pancreatic polypeptide.\nAt the last follow-up visit (38 months since diagnosis), clinical and biochemical parameters confirmed remission of CD, and abdominal imaging markers of neuroendocrine neoplasia were also negative.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

She had a 10-pack-year history of smoking cigarettes, but had quit smoking 10 years earlier. She drank alcohol only socially and did not use any illicit drugs. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 145/78 mm Hg, a heart rate of 98 beats/min, and a temperature of 36.5°C. The abdominal examination was unremarkable, including findings of a nontender abdomen, normoactive bowel sounds, and no hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal examination revealed no fecal occult blood. Laboratory analysis showed a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dl, a mean corpuscular volume of 87 fl, a serum iron level of 25 μg/dl, and a total iron binding capacity of 223 μg/dl (iron saturation 11%, compatible with iron deficiency anemia). The serum levels of sodium were 136 mmol/l, potassium 3.7 mmol/l, chloride 98 mmol/l, and bicarbonate 26 mmol/l. The serum creatinine level was 2.71 mg/dl, and blood urea nitrogen was 27 mg/dl. Serum tests of liver function were all within normal limits, except that the alkaline phosphatase level was 263 U/l. The albumin level was low at 2.7 g/dl. The lactate dehydrogenase level was 206 U/l (normal range 100–238). A barium esophagogram revealed no abnormalities. EGD revealed no gross duodenal lesions and some digested food obscuring about 20% of the descending duodenal mucosa despite her having fasted for 8 h before EGD (fig. ). There were no gastric or esophageal lesions. Histologic analysis of esophageal biopsies, performed because of dysphagia, revealed no lesions. Histologic analysis of endoscopic biopsies of the descending duodenum, performed to exclude celiac disease in a patient with suspected iron deficiency anemia, revealed a prominent submucosal lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered plasma cells, consistent with low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and otherwise normal mucosa (fig. ). Immunohistochemistry predominantly revealed B cells, with a strong expression of CD43 and a coexpression of BCL2, findings highly compatible with extranodular marginal zone MALToma (fig. ). Microscopic examination of gastroduodenal biopsies using a modified Giemsa stain (Diff Quick stain; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pa., USA) was negative for H. pylori, as was immunohistochemistry using antibodies to H. pylori. The serum IgG antibody level to H. pylori was 0.41 U/ml (levels of 0.00–0.89 U/ml compatible with no infection). Serum tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody levels were 7.1 U/ml (<20 U/ml negative for celiac disease), with a normal serum IgA level and no monoclonal gammopathy.

            "input": "Near midday an 87-year-old woman activated 911 complaining of shortness of breath. The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.\nThe initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).\nIn the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.\nEn route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.\nUpon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.\nInitial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L.\nFollowing termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?\n\nDelta Gap: delta_gap = anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12",

He had been in good health until 1 year earlier, when he noticed reduced livido. Four months before admission, he noticed frequent headaches, thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria. Because he was voiding urine every hour, he visited his family doctor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a suprasellar mass, and he was thus referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Although polydipsia and polyuria had been gradually relieved by the time of admission, he became aware of increased fatigability.\nAt the time of admission, he was 176 cm tall and weighed 72 kg. His temperature was 37.6°C, pulse rate was 60/min, and blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. No goiter or enlargement of lymph nodes was noted. Axillar and pubic hair were lost and there was palpable erythematous rush on his forehead (). The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory results revealed the following results: blood urea nitrogen 9.6 mg/dL, creatinine 0.79 mg/dL, serum sodium 141 mEq/l, potassium 4.0 mEq/l, chloride 100 mEq/l, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, phosphate 3.7 mg/dL, fasting plasma glucose 80 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 0.07 mg/dL. Endocrinologic data revealed a mild decrease in free T4 level (0.6 ng/dL) with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level (0.9106 μU/mL) and decreased cortisol (4.7 μg/mL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 6 pg/mL), luteinizing hormone (LH; 0.2 mIU/mL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH; 1.3 mIU/mL), and testosterone (0.05 ng/mL) levels. Urinary cortisol was undetectable. Plasma osmolality was 288 mOsm/kgH2O, with a urinary osmolality of 239 mOsm/kgH2O, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) was undetectable (<0.15 pg/mL). Urinary output was from 1.5 to 2.2 L/day.\nHis clinical course and laboratory findings led us to suspect CDI with anterior pituitary dysfunction. We thus performed hormonal provocative tests. The patient was given an infusion of 5% saline at a rate of 0.05 mL/kg for 120 min. Although plasma AVP was undetectable before and after administration of hypertonic saline, urine osmolality (391 mOsm/kgH2O) increased above the plasma levels (296 mOsm/kgH2O) (). Hormonal provocative tests revealed that growth hormone (GH) response to GH-releasing hormone was normal, TSH response to TSH-releasing hormone was low and blunted, and FSH and LH response to LH-releasing hormone were low and blunted (). Although ACTH response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) was normal, cortisol response to CRH was low (maximum 13.0 μg/mL). Cortisol response to rapid ACTH stimulation test was low (maximum 15.9 μg/mL). Results of these hormonal tests were compatible with the diagnosis of CDI with partial GC deficiency.\nMRI revealed enhancing lesion centrally in the pituitary stalk, which spread continuously to the bottom of the third ventricle, and the high intensity of the posterior lobe was lost, compatible with the diagnosis of CDI (). Considering the patient's age, we first suspected of neurohypophysial germinoma. However, this was unlikely because cerebrospinal fluid was negative for malignant cells, and β-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels were normal. Next, we suspected sarcoidosis because chest X-ray revealed hilar enlargement. A biopsy from the skin of the forehead was performed, which revealed noncaseating granuloma composed of epithelioid cells (). Multinucleated giant cells were also present. Thus, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made.\nWhile waiting for histologic confirmation of biopsy results, hydrocortisone replacement was begun with a dose of 20 mg daily. Soon after the replacement therapy was begun, moderate polyuria (3.5–4.0 liters daily) occurred (). After the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed, he was treated with 40 mg of prednisolone and his general condition improved. The hypertonic saline test was repeated while he was taking 40 mg of prednisolone. Plasma AVP was undetectable during the hypertonic saline test and urine osmolality was consistently below plasma levels, which was compatible with a diagnosis of CDI (). He was treated with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP).\nMRI following prednisolone therapy revealed a reduction in the size of the affected lesion. However, his pituitary function remained unchanged, and he is currently being treated with prednisolone, levothyroxine natrium, HCG, and dDAVP.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

It was associated with subconjunctival hemorrhage which prompted him to seek for emergent care. The patient reported sore throat for three weeks prior which was treated with over-the-counter cold medications. Initial vitals reported a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate 82 beats per minute, blood pressure 156/85 mmHg, and respiratory rate 20 per minute. On physical exam, the oropharynx did not show erythema or exudates, no palpable lymphadenopathy. Chest and abdominal exams were benign. Labs showed white cell count 12,800/uL, hemoglobin 14.1 g/dL, and platelet 154,000/uL, sodium 133 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 97 mmol/L, bicarb 19 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 95 mg/dL, creatinine 8.9 mg/dL, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, and liver function tests were normal.

Estimated 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 0.6 g/day. He was admitted and given volume resuscitation and broadly covered with antibiotics by his primary service. Nephrology was consulted in view of acute renal failure, proteinuria, and hematuria. Initial differential diagnoses of his acute kidney injury included PSGN, severe dehydration, IgA nephropathy, and vasculitis. Rapid strep A screening and throat swab culture were negative. C3 and C4 complements were <40 and <8 mg/dL, respectively. Total complement level was <10 U/mL. Anti-DNASE B antibody titer was 770 U/mL, and anti-streptolysin O titer was 285 IU/mL. Autoimmune workup was negative except antinuclear antibody titer of 1:160, and positive cryoglobulin with low cryoprecipitate. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed small bilateral pleural effusions, no renal masses or obstruction as well as normal appearing ureters and bladder. With supportive measures, creatinine improved initially, but blood urea nitrogen got worse. On day three of admission, he developed pulmonary congestion and diuresis was tried without success. He subsequently developed uremic symptoms. Intermittent hemodialysis was started as supportive therapy for PSGN, volume overload, and uremic symptoms. In spite of aggressive conservative therapy, he continued to be hypoxemic with persistent bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. It was suspected that he had sequelae of pulmonary-renal syndrome despite negative serology. Thus, he underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage which ruled out alveolar hemorrhage. He also underwent renal biopsy on day 22 of hospitalization. Renal biopsy identified acute tubular injury, enlarged glomeruli, endocapillary proliferation, neutrophils on light microscopy (Figure ), granular staining in capillary loops for C3 on direct immunofluorescence (Figure ), and subepithelial hump-like immune deposits on electron microscopy (Figure ). He had no evidence of tubular atrophy or interstitial fibrosis. The biopsy findings were consistent with PSGN. He was intubated for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and intravenous pulse dose steroids were initiated. He received three days of 1 g intravenous methylprednisolone followed by 500 mg daily for six days. The serum creatinine rapidly came down with daily improvement in urine output without further dialysis requirements. The trend of serum creatinine in relation to hemodialysis and steroids therapy is demonstrated in Figure . He was discharged with 20 days tapering course of oral prednisone. On the day of discharge, his serum creatinine was 1 mg/dL. On follow-up, renal function remained to be normal. He no longer required supplemental oxygen, and prednisone was tapered off.

She had a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 226/136 mmHg, respiration rate of 16 breaths per minute and arterial oxygen saturation of 96%. Blood analysis showed a serum creatinine level of 10.97 mg/dl (nv 0.5-1.1) and urea 109 mg/dL (nv 16-46) mmol/L. The patient also presented with bilateral AMLs, hypertension and seizure disorder. Her relatives reported difficulty in managing her home medications (antihypertensive and antiepileptic drugs) due to her intellectual disability. The patient had been diagnosed with TSC in childhood; there was a paternal family history of TSC. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in end-stage renal failure appeared four years prior and the patient has been undergoing peritoneal dialysis since the diagnosis. At the age of 18 years, she underwent a prior unilateral endovascular embolization to treat renal aneurisms and the procedure successfully stopped a bleeding aneurism at the upper pole of the right kidney. Based on the patient’s medical history, clinical and biochemical findings, a ruptured renal artery aneurysm was diagnosed. An urgent renal AE was considered the treatment of choice to limit hemorrhage and the risk of damage to the peritoneal dialysis catheter. The multidisciplinary team, including pediatric surgeons, interventional radiologists, pediatric nephrologists and psychologists agreed upon the choice to perform a bilateral renal AE in this complex patient. Prior to the intervention, and after being informed on the nature of the intervention, the patient and the patient’s parents gave their written consent to undergo endovascular treatment. Under general anesthesia, ultrasound-guided right femoral common artery access was gained using a Terumo 6 FR 11 cm catheter. A diagnostic plain angiography scan revealed a double right renal artery. The major artery was easily catheterized with a 6 FR C2 Mac Boston-Scientific 6 F (65 cm) catheter. Through this catheter, a AMplatzer Plug-2 10 mm was released achieving artery occlusion (about 1 cm from the ostium, ). A Sim1 Boston-Scientific 5 fr was positioned in the lower right renal artery and several Terumo Azur coils were released (). Upon completion of the intervention, angiography confirmed the complete embolization of the vessels (). The same procedure was used for the left renal embolization using a Cobra C2 catheter and Terumo 4x10 mm Azur coils (). With the final angiography, bilateral renal arterialthrombosis was confirmed (about 1 cm from the ostium, ). The first cm of the renal artery was preserved to facilitate clamping during the future nephrectomy. After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of our institution for observation and subsequently to the pediatric nephrology unit. Vital signs were monitored; her postoperative course was uneventful. Two months later, the patient underwent a bilateral lumbotomy and bilateral extraperitoneal nephrectomy to protect the peritoneal surface area and dialysis adequacy. Grossly, both kidneys were enlarged (left 14.5x7x6 cm; right 15x5x5.5 cm); macroscopically the tissue was almost entirely replaced by cysts alternating with solid grey and brown areas, on a background of soft and yellowish tissue with calcific deposits. Histologically, solid areas on the yellowish background were revealed to be angiomyolipoma, which extended to the adipose tissue, perirenal and the renal pelvis. Partially solid aspects (epithelioid angiomyolipoma) and partially cystic aspects (cysts with cubic or hobnail epithelium) were observed. In the right kidney, other solid greyish areas were observed (maximum diameter 15 mm); these were classified as renal cell carcinomas (RCC), with acinar, papillary and alveolar growth patterns and cribiform aspects, Furhrman grade III (). The patient was discharged on the fourth day of hospitalization in stable clinical condition. Her clinical condition and laboratory tests were stable at 12 months follow-up.

Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was carried out under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation because of declining general condition. Since respiratory functions had deteriorated dramatically, the child was transferred to our institution for ECMO-support (at 4 wk after first presentation). No definite diagnosis existed to that time.\nMedical history taking with the parents revealed an uneventful pregnancy and birth in Germany. The parents originated from the Balkan peninsula. The patient was the first child and the parents claimed to be healthy.\nThe child was unconscious due to deep analgo-sedation (Glasgow coma score of 3/15). The vesical temperature was 40.3°C, heart rate was 142 bpm, blood pressure was 82/44 mmHg (under continuous infusion with epinephrine 2.0 mcg/kg/min), weight was 7.9 kg (15th percentile, World Health Organization scale), length was 70 cm (30th percentile, World Health Organization scale), SpO2 was 70%. The pressure-controlled ventilation maintained peak inspiratory pressure of 60 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 12 cm H2O, FiO2 of 1.0, frequency of 40 pm, and Horovitz quotient of 30. The spleen was 5 cm and the liver 6 cm, palpable in midclavicular lines. Our first clinical impression was that of a systemic infection with severe acute respiratory failure and unexplained lymphoproliferation.\nBlood analysis revealed pancytopenia (hemoglobin: 4.3 mmol/L; leucocytes: 2.600 × 109/L; neutrophils: 800 × 109/L; platelets: 32.000 × 109/L), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (194 mg/L; normal range: <5 mg/L), ferritin (1,020 μg/L; normal range: 14–103 μg/L), triglycerides (3.58 mmol/L normal range: 0.4–1.6mmol/L), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (30,247 U/mL; normal range: 158–623 U/mL). Analyses of arterial blood gases showed pH of 6.9, pCO2 of 93 mmHg, pO2 of 30 mmHg, and base-excess of −11.1 mmol/L.\nInitial imaging with x-ray showed a “white lung” () and with ultrasound showed hepato- and splenomegaly. Further imaging work-up, with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, could not be performed because of the instable situation.\nBone marrow biopsy showed a distinct hemophagocytosis upon cytologic evaluation (). The lymphocyte population consisted of CD3+ of 1,358 × 109/L, CD4+ of 1,119 × 109/L, CD8+ of 2,017 × 109/L, CD19+ of 487 × 109/L, and CD56+ of 2 × 109/L. Further immunological studies by fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed normal fresh degranulation of natural killer cells (14.7%; normal: >10%), and normal expressions of perforin, CD27, SAP, and XIAP on d 7. Microscopy of the patient's hairs showed no anomaly of pigmentation, as would be found in children with Griscelli syndrome.\nThe patient was further evaluated with cultures of blood, urine, tracheal secretion, and stool. Examinations for ova or parasites provided negative results. All serological and PCR tests for viruses (Epstein–Barr, human immunodeficiency, cytomegaly, hanta, adeno, influenza a/b, respiratory syncytial, herpes simplex, corona, metapneumonia, parvo B19, parainfluenza, rhino, and enterovirus) were negative. Also negative were results of testing for leishmania, legionella, aspergillus, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Hemophilus influenza b, and pneumococcus-PCR/immunoglobulins (IgG/IgM).\nAll tumors markers α-fetoprotein (2.5 IU/mL), neuron-specific enolase (10 ng/mL), ß-hCG (0.2 mIU/mL), homovanillic acid (10 mg/g creatinine), and vanillylmandelic acid (18 mg/g creatinine) were unrevealing.\nA positive result from the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) was the first indication for possible TBC infection on d 12. However, microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (Ziehl–Neelsen stain) as well as PCR testing for TBC in the first bronchoalveolar lavage were both negative on d 6. Further along in the clinical course, PCR for TBC became positive and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture returned positive results on d 40. The identified strain of M. tuberculosis was found to be sensitive to rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and isoniazid, retrospectively.\nAfter discontinuation of the ECMO therapy, further imaging was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system showed a miliary TBC and a computed tomography scan of the thorax revealed a calcified, round lesion consistent with TBC ().\nNormal functional assays virtually excluded hereditary forms of HLH. A secondary form was therefore recommended to be considered, as was a complete diagnostic re-evaluation (infection, tumor, leukemia). The etoposide (VP-16, according to the HLH-04 protocol) was terminated after three doses administered according the HLH protocol.\nThe child presented with severe hypoxia, and respiratory and metabolic acidosis, despite pressure-controlled ventilation and attempts of high frequency oscillation ventilation, both at high inspiratory oxygen level. The decision was therefore made to start veno-venous ECMO immediately after admission of the patient (see ). A 16F Avalon double-lumen cannula (Getinge AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) was inserted in the right internal jugular vein. A blood flow of 120 mL/kg/min was established, which was sufficient to achieve a PaO2 between 85 and 95 mmHg, and a PaCO2 between 40 and 50 mmHg. Ventilator parameters were reduced as much as possible (peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cm H2O, and FiO2 of 0.4) to guarantee “lung protection” as well as a transcutaneous O2-saturation of >90%. After initiation of the ECMO catecholamine support with epinephrine and noradrenaline (maximum dosage of 0.18 μg/kg/min) was progressively weaned (until d 12).\nBecause of the fulfillment of criteria for HLH therapy, the HLH-94 protocol was initiated. The boy was treated with dexamethasone at 10 mg/m2 (d 2 to d 12, and reduced/discontinued at d 24) and etoposide at 150 mg/m2 (three doses in total, given on d 2 through d 7 and being stopped upon normal results from the T cell degranulation assay on d 7). Additionally, intravenous immunoglobulin (0.5 g/kg body weight, given on d 2 through d 15) was administered.\nWith the suspicion of TBC, on d 12 (positive IRGA) a 4-fold tuberculostatic therapy was started, consisting of rifampicin at 1 × 15 mg/kg body weight/d, ethambutol at 1 × 30 mg/kg body weight/d, pyrazinamide at 1 × 30 mg/kg body weight/d, and isoniazid 1 × 10 mg/kg body weight/d). At 10 d after the start of tuberculostatic therapy, there was improvement in the general condition (stable cardiorespiratory situation, rising tidal volumes). The C-reactive protein level declined from 194 mg/L to 5 mg/L on d 28, followed by the soluble interleukin-2 receptor from 30,247 U/mL to 931 U/mL on d 40. After full lung recovery, the ECMO support was able to be discontinued on d 28. The child was extubated on d 33.\nThe boy survived this critical condition. After discharge on d 66, the child was re-evaluated on d 98, d 460, and d 745. During that time, the boy developed frontotemporal hygroma (left side > right side) with spontaneous resolution. Neurological assessment during the follow-up period revealed a mild retardation of development (speech and fine motor skills) and moderate aggressive behavior with beginning improvement.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?\n\nMaintenance Fluids Calculations: maintenance_fluid = base_value + weight_coefficient * weight, where base_value is 60 ml/hr for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 40 ml/hr for patients with a weight between 10kg and 20kg, and 0 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg, and weight_coefficient is 1 for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 2 for patients  with a weight between between 10kg and 20kg, and 4 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg",

            "input": "A 78-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, and no history of any infectious diseases, underwent endovascular stenting (S.M.A.R.T. Control C10060SL, Cordis, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at another hospital for chronic occlusion of the left iliac artery, which had been causing intermittent claudication. No prophylactic antibiotics were administered to the patient during the EVT procedure. The patient was discharged the next day without any complications. However, he developed fever and back pain 20 days later. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was suggestive of an infected aneurysm at the site of the left iliac artery stent, and the patient was referred to our hospital.\nThe patient was 160 cm tall, weighed 62.8 kg, and had a blood pressure of 156/80 mmHg, a pulse of 66 beats/min, and a body temperature of 38°C. Blood tests revealed the following: white blood cells, 13130/µl; red blood cells, 3.33 million/µl; hemoglobin, 9.9 g/dl; platelet count, 190,000/µl; blood urea nitrogen, 26.7 mg/dl; creatinine, 0.93 mg/dl; albumin, 2.4 g/dl; and C-reactive protein, 24.76 mg/dl. CT findings revealed thickening of the arterial wall and an aneurysm of the left common iliac artery at the site of the stent (). On the basis of these findings, he was diagnosed with an infected aneurysm due to bare stent infection and underwent surgical treatment.\nThe terminal abdominal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries were removed because the infection had extended to the aortic bifurcation (). The surrounding infected tissue was debrided, and the terminal aorta was replaced with a rifampicin-soaked bifurcated prosthesis. A pedicled omental flap based on the left gastroepiploic artery was then guided in a retrocolic fashion into the retroperitoneal cavity, to wrap the graft around its entire length.\nThe rifampicin-soaked prosthesis was prepared as follows. First, 300-mg rifampicin capsules (Sandoz Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were dissolved in a mixture of 6-ml high-pressure sterilized polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80, Wako Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) and 54-ml distilled water. This solution was then sterilized in a Millex-HV Syringe Filter Unit (0.45 µm polyvinylidene difluoride, Merck Millipore, Carrigtwohill, County Cork, Ireland). Finally, an 18×10-mm prosthesis (Hemashield Platinum, Maquet, San Jose, CA, USA) was soaked in this rifampicin solution for 15 min.\nHistopathology of the surgically excised artery specimen revealed many inflammatory cells infiltrating the intima, media, and adventitia. Abscesses and masses of Gram-positive cocci were found in all arterial layers, suggestive of an infected aneurysm ().\nStaphylococcus aureus was detected by a bacterial culture of the surgical specimen. Based on the results of his antibiotic susceptibility test, the patient was administered tazobactam/piperacillin 13.5 g/day intravenously for 4 weeks, followed by amoxicillin 750 mg/day orally. However, oral medication was discontinued after 2 weeks due to a side effect, i.e., diarrhea.\nTwo postoperative complications were also treated. For adhesive bowel obstruction, partial small bowel resection was performed. For aspiration pneumonia, meropenem hydrate 1.5 g/day was administered for 1 week.\nThe patient was discharged and fully recovered from his illness. The patient still visits our hospital every 3–6 months for blood tests, Doppler ultrasonography, and CT. Postoperative CT images at the 2-year follow-up revealed no signs of reinfection (). At the 3-year follow-up, the graft remained patent, and no complications were observed.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

He complained of abdominal pain and inability to move his legs beginning five hours prior to arrival. He awakened from a nap that afternoon and experienced numbness in both legs, which progressed to paralysis. At baseline, he was ambulatory without any history of weakness and was last ambulatory hours prior. He endorsed occasional pain in his legs when walking at baseline.\nHe also complained of abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting for two days. He had a history of alcohol use and reported dark-colored emesis and last bowel movement three days prior. On review of symptoms the patient denied any history of headache, dizziness, chest pain, back pain, trauma, fevers, or extremity weakness. He walked longer than a mile the day prior. History from the patient’s wife revealed that he had an episode of altered level of consciousness while on the couch and that finding combined with his abdominal pain and paralysis prompted her to call 911. The patient’s past medical history was significant for hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and myocardial infarction 10 years prior. His past surgical history included “abdominal stents” and a left carotid stent. His social history was significant for a 25-pack/year history of smoking and daily alcohol. His medications included atenolol and ranitidine.\nPhysical exam showed an oral temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure 107/65mmHg, heart rate 99 beats/minute and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, with oxygen saturation on 15L non-rebreather mask of 94%. His weight was 72.5kg and he appeared older than his stated age. He was alert, cooperative and in moderate distress, primarily complaining of pain and cramping in his lower extremities and repeatedly asking staff to straighten out his legs although they were already lying straight and motionless on the gurney. His head exam was unremarkable with the exception of a dry oropharynx. Cervical spine, cardiac, and lung exams were unremarkable. His abdomen was firm and diffusely tender to palpation with generalized rebound and guarding. An irreducible left inguinal hernia was present. He had vomiting, and placement of a nasogastric tube revealed 1.5 liters of coffee-ground emesis. Lower extremities were thin, cool, and without any palpable or Dopplerable pulses in bilateral femoral, popliteal or pedal distribution. There was trace non-reproducible sensation to the mottled lower extremities, and no sensation distal to the ankles. Motor exam was significant for lower extremity paralysis.\nLaboratory data consisted of sodium 121mEq/L (135–145), potassium 6.8mEq/L (3.3–4.8), chloride 89mEq/L (101–111), CO2 18mEq/L (25–34), BUN 31mg/dL (8–26), creatinine 1.5mg/dL (0.5–1.3), and blood glucose 367mg/dL (70–115). White blood cell 19.1thous/mcL (4.0–10.5), hemoglobin 12.8g/dL (13.5–16.9), lipase 107U/L (22–51), hematocrit 38.8% (39.5–50.0), and platelets 165thous/mcL (150–400). There was a left shift in the neutrophils 16.2thous/mcL (85%) (2.0–8.1). Alkaline phosphate 88IU/L (26–110), AST 84IU/L (8–40), ALT 38IU/L (0.0–60), total bilirubin 1mg/dL (0.0–1.4), total protein 5.4g/dL (6.1–8.2), albumin 2.6g/dL (3.2–5.5). Lactate 7.2mmol/L (0.7–2.1). ABG showed pH of 7.25 (7.38–7.42), pCO2 31.6mmHg (36–42), pO2 123.6mmHg (80–104), bicarbonate 13.5mmol/L (21–27). PT was 17.3sec (9.5–12.3), PTT 45.9sec (24.1–35.1), and INR 1.62 (0.87–1.14). B-type natriuretic peptide 1,950pg/mL (<100). Troponin 2.75ng/mL (<0.03).\nChest radiograph was unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 95 beats/minute with ST elevation inferiorly, anteriorly and laterally (). Bedside ultrasound to evaluate the abdominal aorta was limited. Vascular surgery was consulted prior to CT for concern of a vascular catastrophe. Cardiology was consulted for the patient’s ECG findings consistent with myocardial infarction. The patient went for a non-contrast head CT that was unremarkable and a CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, which was significant for the abdominal aorta with no contrast opacification 2.2cm superior to the bifurcation (), high-grade stenosis of the right common iliac artery, complete occlusion of the left common iliac artery, stents in the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), evidence of occlusion of the proximal SMA and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), hepatic, splenic, bilateral renal infarctions, left inguinal hernia, bowel obstruction, pneumatosis intestinalis with evidence of ischemic bowel, and aspiration in the right lower lung. General surgery was consulted.\nThe cardiology service stated that the patient was not a candidate for cardiac catheterization and to start anticoagulation and low-dose aspirin if there was no contraindication or planned surgery. They also recommended thrombolytics for the diffuse thrombotic disease. The patient did have an echocardiography study that revealed an ejection fraction of 35% and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. General surgery recommended comfort measures as he was not a surgical candidate. Vascular surgery commented that bypass would be futile and if patient survived, would be a candidate for extra-anatomical axillo-bifemoral bypass in the future. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit for broad-spectrum antibiotics and a heparin drip and succumbed to his illness the following day.\n\nWhat is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?\n\nAnion Gap: anion_gap = sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L))",

He had multiple comorbidities: old pulmonary tuberculosis, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. His medications included spironolactone, glimepiride, metformin, amlodipine, and telmisartan. Two weeks earlier, however, he was diagnosed with pulmonary aspergillosis and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at the outpatient department (OPD). A pulmonologist and a cardiologist prescribed oral voriconazole (200 mg twice a day) and dronedarone (400 mg twice a day), respectively. At this time, serum sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 5.5 mmol/L, and creatinine was 0.91 mg/dL. shows the chest radiographic findings.\nAt admission, the patient's blood pressure was 124/52 mmHg, and no focal neurologic deficit was noted on physical examination. Serum sodium was 133 mmol/L, potassium was 8.0 mmol/L, calcium was 9.3 mg/dL, phosphorus was 4.7 mg/dL, and creatinine was 1.57 mg/dL. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation and left bundle branch block (). The severe hyperkalemia appeared to be caused by spironolactone and telmisartan coadministration, and these offending agents were discontinued. In addition, hyperkalemia was antagonized by intravenous calcium gluconate and was corrected by administration of intravenous insulin lispro and calcium polystyrene sulfonate. His proteinuria was persistent, reaching 1,131 mg/d in a 24 h urine collection. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.007, pH 5.0, albumin 1+, red blood cells 5–9/high power field (HPF), and white blood cells 3-4/HPF. Because monoclonal gammopathy was suggested from serum and urine protein electrophoresis, a kidney biopsy was performed. Light microscopic examination revealed two global scleroses among 17 glomeruli sampled and showed marked mesangial expansion with mesangial hypercellularity and global thickening of the glomerular capillary walls. Immunofluorescence revealed lambda light chain-restricted glomerular mesangial and linear capillary loop staining (). Electron microscopic evaluation showed vague, fine granular, amorphous deposits in the mesangium and along the peripheral capillary walls. These pathologic findings were compatible with light chain deposition disease. The immunofixation test revealed that heavy and light chains were IgG and λ, respectively. However, no osteolytic lesions were found, and the bone marrow was normocellular. Thus, he was discharged without specific treatment while maintaining voriconazole.\nNine days later, the patient was readmitted because of gait disturbance and dysarthria. Brain imaging revealed no acute lesion. Bradyarrhythmia was noted (), and acute hemodialysis was undertaken to treat both hypercalcemia (11.7 mg/dL) and hyperkalemia (7.5 mmol/L). Urine sodium was 127 mmol/L, potassium was 19 mmol/L, chloride was 125 mmol/L, creatinine was 36 mg/dL, and osmolality was 372 mOsm/kg H2O. The transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was calculated to be 2.02, and arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.354, pCO2 38.5 mmHg, pO2 110 mmHg, and HCO3− 20.9 mmol/L. Results of the following endocrine tests were unremarkable: plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone concentration, intact-PTH, and stimulated cortisol. Vitamin D levels were low, and PTH-related peptide was undetectable. We considered the possibility of voriconazole-induced hyperkalemia; therefore, voriconazole was discontinued. Because the follow-up ECG showed the atrial fibrillation was resolved, dronedarone was discontinued. At discharge, his serum sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 4.1 mmol/L, calcium was 9.5 mg/dL, phosphorus was 3.7 mg/dL, protein was 7.5 g/dL, albumin was 3.1 g/dL, and creatinine was 0.69 mg/dL.\nApproximately one month later, the patient was readmitted because of massive hemoptysis and required bronchial artery embolization. The pulmonologist prescribed itraconazole to treat pulmonary aspergillosis. One week later, however, itraconazole was switched to a reduced dose (100 mg twice a day) of voriconazole. In the meantime, antihypertensives were switched to manidipine and propranolol.\nSixteen days after voriconazole had been resumed, serum potassium had increased to 5.7 mmol/L, and one day later, the patient again visited the ER because of chest tightness. His serum sodium was 130 mmol/L, potassium was 8.0 mmol/L, calcium was 8.9 mg/dL, phosphorus was 5.8 mg/dL, and creatinine was 1.63 mg/dL. An ECG suggested complete atrioventricular block (), and he recovered normal sinus rhythm after acute hemodialysis (). Once again, voriconazole was replaced with itraconazole (200 mg once a day). Manidipine was discontinued because of the potential drug interaction between azole antifungals and calcium channel blockers. Plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone were 0.26 (normal, 0.32–1.84) ng/mL/h and 3.0 (normal, 4.2–20.9) ng/dL, respectively. No further electrolyte disturbances were noted during the admission for three weeks, and his final follow-up laboratory findings were: serum sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 4.4 mmol/L, calcium 9.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.4 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.85 mg/dL.\n\nWhat is the patient's Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)?

            "input": "An 80-year-old woman, 155 cm in height and 70 kg in weight, was admitted to our institution via the emergency room due to a right femur fracture. The patient had a 5-year history of hypertension, which was relatively well controlled with the medication regimen of an antihypertensive agent and aspirin. She did not exercise much due to obesity and depression. She showed delirium symptoms after admission and underwent brain computerized tomography (CT) to exclude organic brain diseases. A brain CT showed severe stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), an old localized infarction of the basal ganglia, and diffuse atrophy of the brain. She exhibited cardiomegaly on the preoperative chest X-ray, 1 degree A-V block on EKG, an ejection fraction of 65% on echocardiography and other blood studies, and her vital signs are within the normal limits. The preoperative PT/PTT was 12.7/24.4 seconds, INR was 1.15, and arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) revealed the following: pH 7.376, PaO2 78.6 mmHg, PaCO2 27.5 mmHg.\nOn the 4th hospital day, she was scheduled to undergo total hip replacement surgery and aspirin was maintained until the 3rd hospital days. Upon arrival at the operating theater, standard monitoring devices were applied and the left radial artery was cannulated for continuous blood pressure monitoring. The patient's blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and O2 saturation was 140/70 mmHg, 80 beats/min, and 98%, respectively, through a simple facial mask with 4 L/min of oxygen. Spinal anesthesia was administered with the patient in the right lateral position using a 26-gauge Quincke spinal needle at the L3-4 interspace with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 8 mg under standard aseptic conditions. The patient was then placed in the supine position. During the pin-prick test, the patient became unresponsive with BP 70/40 mmHg and HR 40-45 beats/min. Repeated ephedrine administration intravenously (IV) followed by epinephrine 10 µg and full dripping of the crystalloid did not increase the BP. Endotracheal intubation was performed after 7-8 minutes of manual ventilation and norepinephrine 0.1 µg/kg/min, dopamine 2 µg/kg/min were administered continuously. The patient's BP and HR was still 60/40 mmHg and 110 beats/min, respectively, and IV epinephrine 0.02 µg/kg/min was started. The ABGA at that time revealed the following: PaO2 = 488.9 mmHg, PaCO2 = 30.8 mmHg at FiO2 1.0, and EtCO2 = 28 mmHg and O2 saturation = 99%. The cause was suspected to be high spinal anesthesia rather than a pulmonary embolism because of the ABGA findings. Central venous catheterization via the right internal jugular vein was performed to administer the drugs and for hemodynamic monitoring. The central venous pressure was 30 mmHg and emergent TEE was performed immediately. TEE revealed an enlargement of the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV), straightening of the interventricular septum and hypokinesia, which were consistent with PE. IV heparine 5,000 IU was administered and maintained at 1,000 IU/hr. 50 µg/kg of milrinone IV was loaded for 10 minutes and maintained at 0.5 µg/kg/min to manage RV failure. The ABGA results exhibited pH 7.224, PaO2 55.2 mmHg and PaCO2 52.8 mmHg, which were also consistent with PE.\nThe operation was postponed and the patient was transported to the intensive care unit (ICU).

She was also chronically infected with P. aeruginosa and was placed on the active waiting list for BLT from January 2009. From October 2008 to March 2010, the patient had a dramatic deterioration of her pulmonary functional tests with a chronically persistent septic status and intermittent fever. During this period, apart from P. aeruginosa (resistant to all antibiotics except colistin), a colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacterium was isolated seven times from Cepacia agar. P. pulmonicola was eventually identified by routine analysis by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) [] and confirmed with 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis (99.9% of similarity with GenBank accession number AF139175) (Strain 9405935, Fig. ). The susceptibility profile of this organism demonstrated that the organism was initially susceptible only to tigecycline and rifampin, and resistant to ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, tazocillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamycin, tobramycin, fosfomycin, rifampin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, colistin, ciprofloxacin and cefpirome.\nIn March 2010 the patient was admitted to the adult CF reference centre in Marseille for persistent haemoptysis and worsening of pulmonary infection. On examination she had fever (38°C), and had lost 4 kg in weight during the previous 6 months. She presented stage III NYHA dyspnoea, cough and purulent expectoration. Axial lung computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large parenchymal cavity that occupied almost all the right upper lobe, with a thick lobulated wall (maximum thickness 7.5 mm) interpreted as an infarct pneumonia (Fig. ). Relevant laboratory findings included a white blood cell count of 17, 78 G/L, a platelet count of 405 G/L, C-reactive protein at 36 mg/L, and fibrinogen at 4.8 g/L. She had a new procedure of therapeutic bronchial artery embolization and an intravenous antibiotherapy with tigecycline 50 mg × 2/day, colistin 2M × 3/day, meropenem 2 g × 3/day and tobramycin 450 mg/day was started. The patient received continuous oxygen therapy and intermittent non-invasive ventilation but there was poor progress after 14 days with such therapy. The patient finally underwent BLT 3 weeks after her admission. Her condition worsened 5 days after lung transplantation and P. aeruginosa was isolated from blood cultures, lymph nodes, bronchoalveolar lavage, liquid drains and pleural liquid whereas P. pulmonicola was cultured only from one bronchoalveolar lavage on postoperative day 19. A CT scan of the lung showed diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities and a parenchymal cavity 40 mm in diameter in the left upper lobe (Fig. ).

During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations and his modified diet continued, and he has been followed up for 12 months.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

His past medical history was notable for hypertension and gout, which was controlled with colchicine, febuxostat, and indomethacin. He had undergone right olecranon bursectomy and tenotomy approximately two years prior to presentation, but reported good healing and no pain following this procedure, and otherwise denied recent trauma to the elbow. In addition, in his profession as a farmer, he routinely worked within a fenced area containing horses and pigs, including working on his elbows to clear brush and animal waste. On physical examination, he was noted to be febrile with an oral temperature of 41°C. A small aperture with purulent drainage was noted at the superior portion of his right olecranon bursa. Aspiration of bursal fluid was performed, with microscopic evaluation revealing rare polarizable crystals consistent with pseudogout. Following aspiration, the patient was admitted to the hospital. Initial laboratory data were notable for serum sodium 126 mmol/L, serum creatinine 178 μmol/L (elevated from his baseline value of 75 μmol/L), serum glucose 36.8 mmol/L, hemoglobin A1c 14.2%, white blood cells 7.4 × 109/L, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 14 mm/hr. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a prominent soft tissue mass adjacent to the olecranon bursa and the posterior aspect of the medial epicondyle (). The patient underwent incision and debridement of the right olecranon bursa, and intraoperative cultures were obtained. After this procedure, infectious disease consultation was requested, and an antimicrobial regimen consisting of intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and vancomycin was initiated. On postoperative day 1, cultures from the initial bursa aspiration in the outpatient setting revealed diphtheroids. Subsequent identification of Corynebacterium jeikeium was reported 24 hours later by the hospital-based Vitek 2® microbial identification system. On postoperative day 3, the patient was clinically improved, without significant pain, and was discharged from the hospital to receive oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for an additional 14 days. Due to concern for infection, as well as the patient's renal function, he received neither corticosteroids nor nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication during or following hospitalization. Both aspiration and intraoperative cultures were sent to a reference laboratory (Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, MN, USA) for bacterial identification and in vitro susceptibility testing. T. bernardiae was isolated as the sole pathogen utilizing matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (score 2.1 with homology of the top ten results). In vitro susceptibility was determined by use of manual agar dilution which demonstrated activity of doxycycline as well as other antimicrobial agents ().

The patient did not have any cardiac complaints and did not suffer from angina pectoris or dyspnoea. The patient had advanced gonarthrosis of the left knee, advanced degeneration of the cervical spine and advanced bilateral omarthrosis. His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.\nOn physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.\nResults of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.\nAn echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.\nA histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.\nBased on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).\nAt follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition.

He was born from an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. He was in good health until 1 month before the visit when his parents noticed weakness of left lower extremity. He received OPV with DTaP at local health center 1 month before presenting those symptoms. Making the diagnosis in this case was somewhat delayed because his parents hesitated to seek a proper medical help initially and took him to an orthopedics clinic where he was evaluated and treated under a misdiagnosis. His family history and past medical history of perinatal period were unremarkable.\nHis body weight was 8.1 kg, length 66 cm, and head circumference 41.2 cm and those growth indexes measurements continued to be in the 50-90th percentile at the time of this report (2 yr old). Vital signs were not remarkable. The physical examination revealed alert mental status, and cranial nerve function tests were all normal. Neurologic examination revealed markedly decreased spontaneous movement and flaccid paralysis on the left lower extremity (GI/V) with knee jerk (+/-), biceps tendon reflex (+/+), and ankle clonus (-/-). The response to painful stimuli on the left lower extremity was markedly reduced, but there was normal in other part of his body. He had no history of intramuscular injection or trauma on the left side buttock area. Laboratory evaluation, simple skeletal radiography, hip joint sonogram, and 3-phase bone scan were all within normal ranges. Brain and spinal MRI showed no abnormalities. Electrodiagnostic evaluations showed normal sensory nerve action potentials and low amplitudes in left tibial and deep peroneal nerve.\nUp to the time of this presentation, he was able to sit alone at 10 months old and walk unaided (left side heel walking) at 16 months of age. His development quotients (by Korean developmental screening test) of gross motor, fine motor, personal-social, language, and cognitive-adaptation were all 100 in each category. Bayley scales of infant showed mildly delayed performances. His upper limb diameters (mid-arm) were 7.5/7.5 cm, diameters of lower extremities were 30.5/28 cm at the mid-thigh and 22/20 cm at the mid-calf level.

Her symptoms had begun 5 days earlier. She had myalgia and showed progressive difficulty of proximal muscle activities more than distal muscle activities, without signs of muscle wasting. The patient had no ptosis, and her respiration was normal. A dermatologic exam was unremarkable. She had no history of diarrhea or toxin exposure. Her daily medication consisted of a tablet of ferrous fumarate and a single supplement containing iron, iodine, and folic acid (Triferdine). She had no significant prior antenatal history, no hearing problem, no sign of autoimmune disease, no history of dry eyes or dry mouth, no history of diuretic intake, no history of chronic alcohol intake, and no family history of weakness and hypokalemia.\nIn the initial assessment, the patient was afebrile, and her blood pressure was 109/65 mmHg. A neurological examination revealed the following motor power: grade 3/5 in both arms, grade 4/5 in both forearms, grade 4/5 in both thighs, and grade 5/5 in both legs. All the deep tendon reflexes were 2+. The well-being of the fetus was assured by a nonstress test. Normal fetal bone development and mineralization were observed by ultrasound.\nInvestigations showed a total leukocyte count of 8,310/mm3 (5000–10000), with a neutrophil count of 68% (40–75), a lymphocyte count of 24% (20–50), a monocyte count of 6% (2–10), and eosinophil count of 2% (1–6). The hemoglobin was 11.7 g (11–15), platelets were 261,000 cells/mm3 (140,000–400,000), serum potassium was 2.0 mmol/L (3.5–5.0), sodium was 139.5 mmol/L (135–145), and chloride was 108 mmol/L (97–110). Bicarbonate was 19.9 mmol/L (22–32), and it decreased over the next few days to 16.0 mmol/L. In addition, albumin was 3.2 g/dL (3.4–5.0), calcium was 9.7 mg/dL (8.4–10.4), corrected serum calcium was 10.34 mg/dL, magnesium was 1.8 mg/dL (1.8–2.4), phosphorus was 3.8 mg/dL (2.5–4.5), blood sugar was 114 mg%, BUN was 4.1 mg/dL (7–18), creatinine was 0.52 mg/dL (0.55–1.02), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 194 U/L (15–37), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 124 U/L (0–65), globulin was 2.7 g/dL (2.8–3.3), total bilirubin was 0.43 g/dL (0.0–10.0), direct bilirubin was 0.22 mg/dL (0–0.50), and alkaline phosphatase was 137 U/L (40–150). Urine analysis was negative for blood and urinary tract infections. The urinary pH was 7.0 (5.0–7.5) on a pH meter, and the urinary ketone level was 2+. CPK was 5,338 IU/L (<145). Thyroid function tests were in the normal limit for a third-trimester pregnancy, and serum morning cortisol was mildly increased. Urine was collected after 24 h. The 24 h urine potassium level was elevated at 77 mmol, suggesting hypokalemia from renal losses. Serum anion gap was 13.6 mmol/L. The reduction in bicarbonate and normal anion gap pointed to normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient had no history of extrarenal causes of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis such as vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal fistula, and laxative abuse. These data suggest renal tubular acidosis as a cause. Urine pH of 7.0 pointed out that kidneys could not acidify urine compatible with distal tubular dysfunction. Her serum phosphate was normal and she had no glucosuria. Serum bicarbonate easily increased to 20.9 mmol/L after 0.36 mEq/kg administration. So, all data suggest that she had distal RTA. Then she had no history and no clinical suggestion of anemia and autoimmune disease and had no history of deafness, and besides the fact that screening tests for the underlying causes of the distal RTA were normal the etiology in this case was indeterminate. The serum uric acid was 4.1 mg/dL, antinuclear antibody was negative, and a whole abdomen ultrasound showed mild hydronephrosis, without any detectable renal mass or stones.\nTreatments included hydration, correction of the metabolic acidosis with alkali therapy, and potassium supplementation. The patient's clinical and laboratory test results gradually improved. One week after starting the treatments, all the laboratory test results were negative. The patient was discharged.\nAt 412/7 weeks of gestation, the patient was diagnosed with failure to progress and was taken to the operating room for a cesarean section. A healthy male newborn was delivered. The newborn weighted 3,360 g at birth, and he had an Apgar score of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. Thin meconium-stained amniotic fluid was found. The operation and postpartum period were uneventful. On follow-up, serum electrolytes, CPK, and creatinine were within normal limits. At the 6-week postpartum check-up, the patient was in good health. She received an injection of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) for contraception.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?\n\nDelta Gap: delta_gap = anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12",

The patient had history of old pulmonary tuberculosis, a cataract operation 10 years ago and several orthopedic surgeries for the fracture of both lower extremities due to a traffic accident 20 years ago. The patient had no diabetes, and hypertension. Familial history was unremarkable. Smoking history was 40 pack years, and the patient stopped smoking 12 years ago. He had 135 g of daily alcohol (three bottles of raw rice wine) consumption for 30 years. Alcohol intake was discontinued four years ago.\nChronic ill appearance, drowsy mental status, crusts and bruises of lower extremities, and abdominal distension without fluid wave shifting were noted on physical examinations. The patient did not complain of claudication ordinarily. His cirrhosis status was Child-Pugh B without ascites and hypersplenism-related pancytopenia. The initial vital signs were blood pressure 150/70 mmHg, heart rate 64 beats/min, respiration rate 20 breaths/min, and body temperature 36℃. The initial laboratory evaluation revealed WBC 26240 (poly: 85.6%) cells/µL, hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL, platelet 1.76×105 cells/µL, prothrombin time 14.7 seconds, international normalized ratio 1.26 (71%), ammonia 168 µmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 27.3 mg/dL, creatinine 3.16 mg/dL, albumin 2.83 g/dL, total bilirubin 2.11 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 34 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 16 U/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 18 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 220 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 605 IU/L, Na 137 mEq/L, K 4.7 mEq/L, Cl 114 mEq/L, HCV RNA 1.9×105 copies/mL and metabolic acidosis. Urine sodium was 61 mEq/L with no proteinuria. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly and emphysematous change. Non-enhanced abdominal CT was unremarkable. Before admission, he had difficulty in defecation for 4 days. The first impression was grade III (graded with the West Haven Criteria) hepatic encephalopathy caused by constipation. Lactulose enema and administration of empirical antibiotics for infection of unknown origin related to leukocytosis were applied. And six months previously, his creatinine level was only 1.63 mg/dL. We suspected of type II hepatorenal syndrome overlapped with hepatic encephalopathy.\nAlthough the combination therapy of fluid replacement and diuretics started, his creatinine level was elevated to 4.02 mg/dL during 10 days. The urine output for 24 hours decreased to 500 mL. The patient was diagnosed with HRS on the basis of the criteria outlined by the International Ascites Club.\nOn the admission day 11, intravenous terlipressin along with albumin (20%, 100 mL) was administered for the management (1 mg q 4 hour) of HRS. He complained of severe cramping abdominal pain whenever a single injection of bolus terlipressin was administered. This complication was common, predictable, and thoroughly controlled by means of low-dose analgesics. Total urine output per 24 hours increased to 3,650 mL in 10 days when terlipressin was injected. On the admission day 22, the patient's clinical condition improved, and mentality changed to a clear state. The chemistry panel of the patient decreased: BUN to 30.63 mg/dL and creatinine to 1.29 mg/dL. However, on the day 11 after the terlipressin administration, the patient complained of severe tearing pain of both lower legs, and discoloration, necrosis, and gangrene were found in the 1st and 2nd toes of the right foot and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd toes of the left foot on physical examination. The terlipressin injection was discontinued immediately. These changes progressed to ischemia throughout the feet, accompanied by poor peripheral pulse and delayed wound healing as shown in .\nThe wounds in both feet were dressed with hydrocolloid solution. The patient still complained of continuous pain in both legs. A 3-phase bone scan showed an increased tracer uptake in the right 1st and 2nd toes, and the left toes and tarsal bone. The diagnosis assumed by the bone scan was osteomyelitis with osteonecrosis of the left foot, and osteomyelitis of the right foot (). However, 3-dimension angiographic CT of lower extremities was not taken due to the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.\nFor prevention of the enlargement of gangrene or necrosis and healing tissue damage, intravenous alprostadil (prostaglandin E1, 10 µg/day) was administered continuously. The patient's serum creatinine stabilized during alprostadil administration. On the 6th day after the administration of alprostadil, an oral sildenafil (cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, 50 mg q 12 hour) was added to promote the peripheral circulation. Two days later, his urine output decreased to 445 mL/24h. Serum creatinine level was elevated to 2.8 mg/dL again. The combination therapy of alprostadil and sildenafil was withdrawn promptly. Intravenous furosemide was reintroduced. One week later, the creatinine level decreased again to 1.3 mg/dL, and urine output was held at 2,000 mL/24h. The mental status and clinical condition improved well ().\nThough the lesions of the right 1st and 2nd toes were recovered completely by vigorous dressing and medication, the left three toes with severe necrosis and osteomyelitis needed to be amputated finally (). On the admission day 44, a 3-dimension angiographic CT of the lower extremities was taken. It showed moderate stenosis with multifocal calcified plaques at both femoral and popliteal arteries, and mild stenosis at both anterior tibial arteries. The orthopedic surgeons' final decision was amputation of the left leg below the knee including necrotic three toes.\n\nWhat is the patient's MELDA Na score?\n\nMELD Na (UNOS/OPTN): MELD(i) = [0.957 x ln(Cr) + 0.378 x ln(bilirubin) + 1.120 x ln(INR) + 0.643].

He came to the emergency department with a one-month history of productive cough, shortness of breath, which was associated with fever and night sweating. He reported an 8 kg weight loss in the last month. He denied any other complaints like hemoptysis. He works as a private house driver. He denied any contact with a patient with PTB.\nOn examination, he was spiking high-grade fever with a temperature of 39.2°C; tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30 and tachycardic with a heart rate ranging between 120-130. His blood pressure was within normal limits. The patient was cachectic. Neck examination was unremarkable. Chest examinations showed decreased air entry in the left side in all lung zone with coarse crackles and dull percussion notes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nHis laboratory findings on admission showed mild leukocytosis and anemia with white blood cells (WBCs) level of 11.8 x10^3/uL and Hb level of 11.4 mg/dL. platelet count with normal range. Other labs showed moderate hyponatremia with sodium level 124 mmol/L with CRP of high with value 140 mg/L.

He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air.

Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.\nRenal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.\n\nWhat is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?\n\nAnion Gap: anion_gap = sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L))",

            "input": "The patient is now 20 years old; she is the second child of healthy non-consanguineous parents. There was no family history of liver disease, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia. Since birth, her general health had been good; however, hepatomegaly was noticed during a routine health care visit and therefore, at 5 years of age, the patient was referred to our hospital. At that time, her height was 100.6 cm (-2.0 SD as compared to a normal Japanese girl) and her weight was 14.1 kg (-1.8 SD as compared to a normal Japanese girl) (BMI= 14.1 kg/m2). A physical examination revealed hepatomegaly with moderate elevation of serum transaminases. Jaundice and splenomegaly were absent. She was admitted for further evaluation . Laboratory findings revealed liver dysfunction and hypercholesterolemia (AST 211 IU/L, ALT 321 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 914 IU/L , alkaline phosphatase 971 IU/L, leucine aminopeptidase 272 IU/L, ?-glutamyl transpeptidase 10 IU/L, total cholesterol 207 mg/dL, HDL-cholesterol 45 mg/dL, triglyceride 142 mg/dL, and total bile acid 5.5 mg/L). Serum anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-DNA antibody were negative. Her fasting blood glucose was 91 mg/dL and within the normal range. Glucosuria was detected; however, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed normal glucose levels and insulin responses (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed hepatomegaly with diffuse low density and no mass, suggesting fatty liver change. Ultrasonography and CT demonstrated no abnormalities in other organs. It was suspected that the patient had some degree of liver disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Biopsy specimens showed vacuolar degeneration of individual hepatocytes and macrovesicular steatosis (). Hepatitis, drug-induced disease, and congenital metabolic diseases were excluded, and the origin of the liver disease remained unknown. As the cause of liver disease was not determined, we treated the patient for hypercholesterolemia with ethyl icosapentate, which is not hepatotoxic (). Post-treatment, her serum cholesterol level had decreased to almost within the normal range. Regarding hepatic dysfunction, the patient’s serum transaminase levels were reduced but continued to fluctuate at the upper end of the normal range. A CT scan showed improvement of fatty change in the liver. When the patients was 9 years of age, it was noticed during a routine laboratory evaluation that she had elevated HbA1c (7.3%) and she was reevaluated for diabetes. At this time, her height was 127.4 cm and her body weight was 25.7 kg (these measurements correspond to -1.0 SD for a normal Japanese girl). BMI was calculated as 15.9 kg/m2. The second OGTT showed reductions in both glucose tolerance and insulinogenic index (). The peak level of serum C-peptide after glucagon stimulation remained normal (3.9 ng/mL, normal range >2.0 ng/mL). Islet cell antibodies (ICAs) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody were not detected in the serum. At this time, she was suspected to have MODY3 because of liver disease and negative auto-antibodies. It has been reported that sulphonylureas are effective in the treatment of patients with MODY3 (); however, the use of sulphonylureas in children is not approved by the health insurance authorities in Japan. Since the patient had a reduced insulinogenic index, insulin treatment in a total daily dose of 9 units prior to each meal was initiated. Since that time, the patient’s diabetes has been under good control and her liver dysfunction has been normalized. She is now 20 years old, and her total daily insulin requirement has increased to 36 units, while her HbA1c levels range from 6.5% to 7%. We could not obtain patient and parental consent for a second biopsy.\nBecause the clinical course led to a probable diagnosis of MODY, we analyzed HNF1A, 4A and -1B by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing, according to a previous report (). Sequence analysis of HNF1A identified a heterozygous mutation at the consensus splice donor site of intron 9, which has been previously reported in a MODY3 family (). Neither of the patient’s parents had this base change, indicating that the mutation occurred de novo. However, we could not perform an analysis of somatic mutations of HNF1A in liver tissue, which was previously biopsied, because we did not have access to the samples.\n\nWhat is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

The patient was not compliant with the treatment and was coming erratically for follow-up to the OPD. On examination, the patient was conscious, oriented, dehydrated, and had mild pallor. Examination revealed a pulse rate of 60/minute, blood pressure (BP) of 100/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths/minute, and temperature of 98.6°F. He had bilateral posterior subcapsular cataract and acne on face. Systemic examination revealed tender epigastrium and absent deep tendon reflexes. Rest of the systemic examination was normal.\nInvestigations revealed the following: hemoglobin (Hb) 10.2 g/dL; total leukocyte count (TLC) 5.3 × 109/L; differential leukocyte count (DLC): N 71%, L 20%, M 7.5%; platelet 273 × 109/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 24/1sth; urea 37 mg/dL; creatinine 1.09 mg/dL; bilirubin 1.34 mg/dL; aspartate transaminase (AST) 34 U/L; alanine transaminase (ALT) 50 U/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 450 U/L; total protein 5.9 g/dL; and albumin 3.7 g/dL. Initial blood sugar was 284 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed the following: pH 7.20, pO2 72 mm Hg, sO2 95 mm Hg, pCO2 36 mm Hg, Na+ 137 mEq/L, K+ 2.5 mEq/L, HCO3− 12.1 mEq/L, Cl− 116 mEq/L (100–112 mEq/L). Urine for ketone bodies was negative. His HbA1C was 11.8%. ECG and chest X-ray were normal. 24-hour urinary protein was 100 mg/dL. The USG abdomen was normal. Patient was initially managed with IV normal saline and potassium replacement. After initial resuscitation with IV fluids, and potassium replacement, the patient's blood sugar stabilized to 172 mg/dL random; however, metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia persisted. Then, the possibility of dRTA was thought of. Anion gap was calculated as Na – [HCO3 + Cl], which was normal: 137 – [12.1 + 116] = 8.9 mEq/L. Furthermore, urine pH was 6.0 even at a serum pH of 7.20. The patient was diagnosed as dRTA in view of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with hypokalemia with inability to acidify urine in the presence of systemic metabolic acidosis. Meanwhile, the patient started tolerating oral intake and was started on oral feeds with pre-meal subcutaneous regular insulin. Subsequently, the patient was put on oral sodium bicarbonate tablets at a dose of 2 mEq/kg and oral potassium replacement. His metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia improved markedly. He was discharged with a final diagnosis of T1DM with dRTA.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Delta Ratio: albumin_corrected_delta_ratio = albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

Vital signs in the ED were temperature, 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 116/66 mmHg; heart rate, 130 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 30; oxygen saturation, 85% on 2 l nasal cannula; weight, 162 kg and body mass index, 47. Physical examination revealed a morbidly obese male in acute respiratory distress with an irregularly irregular pulse and one plus lower extremity pitting oedema. Laboratory values in the ED include white blood cell count, 9 800/μl; haemoglobin, 14.2 g/dl; platelet count, 230 000/μl; sodium, 140 mEq/l; potassium, 4.5 mEq/l; chloride, 104 mEq/l; bicarbonate, 29 mEq/l; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 38 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.4 mg/dl; glucose, 105 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 51 U/l; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 40 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 68 U/l; total bilirubin, 1.5 mg/dl; albumin, 3.4 g/dl; total protein, 7.1 g/dl; international normalised ratio (INR), 1.2; myoglobin, 97 μg/l; troponin, 0.07 ng/ml and B-type natriuretic peptide, 934 pg/ml. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Arterial blood gas showed a pH 7.33, paCO2 68.5 and paO2 88.6 on FiO2 of 40%. Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Echocardiogram revealed a myopathic severely enlarged left ventricular chamber with moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 8 to 10%. The patient's work of breathing and oxygenation improved with Bipap. He was started on diltiazem and diuresis was initiated. The patient was admitted to the step-down unit with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.\nOn hospital day number eight, the overnight nurse found the patient unresponsive. A code blue was called. His initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation and he was shocked with 200 J twice before regaining pulses. When stabilised, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he regained consciousness and full neurologic function within one hour of the event. The following day, an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was placed. Intraoperatively, the patient had runs of ventricular tachycardia with hypotension to 80 mmHg systolic. Postoperatively, the patient was found to have a right fixed mid-dilated pupil, flaccid paralysis of the left arm and leg with hyperreflexia throughout the left side. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed a right midbrain and thalamic stroke thought to be secondary to transient arrhythmia-induced hypoperfusion, intraoperatively.\nOn postoperative day number three, after AICD placement and stroke, the patient acutely developed a rigid distended board-like abdomen with dullness to percussion. Vitals at that time were temperature, 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 112/67 mmHg; heart rate range, 55 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 26 on ventilator settings of assist control volume control with a rate of 26; tidal volume, 500 ml; FiO2, 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5. His peak inspiratory pressure on the ventilator had risen from 26 to 72 mmHg; his plateau had risen from 15 to 48 mmHg with oxygen desaturation from 93 to 85%. The patient had received 1.5 l in and urinated 4.5 l over the 24 hours, leading up to this event. His laboratory values from that morning were unchanged from previous (white blood count, 10 400/μl; haemoglobin, 12.6 g/dl; platelets, 200 000/μl; sodium, 139 mEq/l; potassium, 4.7 mEq/l; chloride, 100 mEq/l; bicarbonate, 34 mEq/l; BUN, 36 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.41 mg/dl; glucose, 78 mg/dl; calcium, 8.3 mg/dl; magnesium, 2.0 mEq/l; phosphorus, 3.0 mg/dl; AST, 77 U/l; ALT, 94 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 186 U/l; total bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dl). This constellation of findings prompted the team to measure an abdominal compartment pressure which was elevated to 53 cm H2O (40 mmHg) with an abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) of 42 mmHg. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed no dilated loops of bowel, no ileus, no evidence of free air, abscess or obstruction and minimal free fluid []. Pertinent labs from the event revealed a lactate of 1.0 mg/dl; lipase, 159 U/l; amylase, 76 U/l; creatinine, 1.53 mg/dl. Surgery was consulted and the FiO2 was increased to 100%, which improved his oxygen saturation to 96% despite his elevated peak inspiratory pressures.\nSurgical recommendations were for an emergent bedside surgical abdominal decompression. The patient was administered 10 mg of intravenous cisatracurium besylate by anaesthesia in preparation for surgical management. Shortly following paralytic administration, his peak inspiratory pressure corrected from 72 to 23 mmHg, his plateau pressure from 48 to 16 mmHg and his oxygenation status tolerated a decrease in FiO2 down to 40% with his oxygen saturation returning to baseline. Measurement of his abdominal compartment pressure revealed a drop from 53 (40 mmHg) to 23 cm H2O (17 mmHg) and then normalised to 15 cm H20 (11 mmHg) over a three-hour period. During this entire event, the patient averaged 100 to 200 cc/hr of urine output and laboratory values from the following day showed a drop in creatinine from 1.53 to 1.29 mg/dl. Given this correction, surgical management was postponed and the patient was monitored. The patient remained hospitalised for an additional 73 days. He was ultimately transferred to a skilled nursing facility without return of symptoms.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?\n\nMean Arterial Pressure (MAP): MAP = 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure)",

Patient, a nonsmoker, nonalcoholic, did not suffer from any other illness and was not taking any medication. He was prescribed a fixed dose combination of atorvastatin and ezetimibe (10 mg each), once a day along with the lifestyle modification in the form of brisk walking for 30–40 min a day.\nTwo months after initiation of therapy and exercise, the patient presented with moderate to severe pain in both legs. History revealed that he had fleeting pain in back, chest, shoulder, and arms 5 days preceding the leg pain. The patient initially attributed the pain to exercise and had stopped going for the walks. However, the pain worsened, causing episodes of nocturnal awakening. Clinical examination did not reveal any abnormality. Laboratory investigations revealed high serum CPK (1991 U/L, normal = 39–308 U/L) and low serum Vitamin D (7.19 ng/mL; normal = 20–100 ng/mL) levels. Other laboratory parameters including blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood urea nitrogen, serum lactate dehydrogenase, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes, serum Vitamin B12, and electrocardiogram were normal.

The diarrhea was watery and continuous of 1-day duration accompanied by chills. He denied shortness of breath or chest pain.\nOur patient was hospitalized in another facility 14 days before presenting to the emergency department of our hospital, and was found to have Candida parapsilosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa endocarditis. A 2D echocardiogram was done there and showed vegetation of the prosthetic mitral valve, with normal aortic prosthesis. He was discharged with a peripherally inserted catheter (PIC) line and on intravenous antibiotics namely, tobramycin, cefepime and fluconazole. No valve replacement was performed at that time due to ongoing injection drug use. He was only out for 1 day before presenting to our emergency department.\nHis past medical history was significant for aortic and mitral valve replacement 1 year before this hospitalization for endocarditis. He also had stage 3 chronic kidney disease.\nAt initial presentation, he was found to be febrile at 100.3°F and hypotensive at a blood pressure of 85/50. His physical examination revealed a 3/6 systolic murmur in the aortic area with radiation to the precordium, and a 2/6 diastolic murmur over the mitral area without radiation.\nHis initial laboratory investigations showed white blood cell count of 19.2 k/μL with 93% neutrophils, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 26 mg/dL, creatinine 2.2 mg/dL, serum bicarbonate 16 mmol/L, chloride 112 mmol/L, sodium 136 mmol/L, magnesium 1.2 mmol/L. Prothrombin time was 15 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.17. Urine toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines. Troponin level was 2.2 ng/mL (normal<0.4). Initial blood cultures were drawn in the emergency department and later grew P. aeruginosa susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and tobramycin. Serology was positive for Hepatitis C infection and negative for HIV infection.\nOn presentation, he was admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of septic shock. He was started on intravenous vancomycin, tobramycin, micafungin and cefepime.\nThree sets of blood cultures grew C. parapsilosis susceptible to fluconazole, itraconazole and 5 flucytosine, and P. aeruginosa susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and tobramycin.\nA 2D echocardiogram showed a bioprosthetic aortic valve with a medium, 10 mm, pedunculated, highly mobile vegetation of the aortic valve attached to the posterior aortic annulus. There was no significant aortic valvular regurgitation. There was mild mitral valvular regurgitation.\nAt day 2 of hospitalization, a transesophageal echocardiogram was done. It showed no aortic abscess but small, 5 mm, mobile vegetation of the aortic valve attached to the non-coronary cusp without significant regurgitation. It also showed large, 10 mm, mobile mitral valve vegetation attached to the anterior leaflet without significant regurgitation.\nThe hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure and acute heart failure for which the patient was aggressively resuscitated. He was electively intubated and medically stabilized to undergo valve replacement 5 days later. Ethical and logistic considerations were the focus of an extensive discussion among the different treating medical and surgical teams given the active injecting drug use while being treated for a relapse of infective endocarditis. The decision was finally made to proceed with the valve replacement surgery. The patient was kept in hospital for the duration of intravenous antibiotics to ensure adherence to therapy and to prevent use of the intravenous access for illicit drug use.\nAt day 7 of hospitalization, he underwent aortic and mitral valve replacement. Cultures from the valves also grew P. aeruginosa and C. parapsilosis. All blood cultures drawn after day 1 were negative.\nTobramycin and cefepime were given for 6 weeks postoperatively. Tobramycin trough levels were measured frequently to ensure therapeutic levels. Micafungin was given for 5 days postoperatively, and replaced by anidulafungin that was given for 26 days.

A para-aortic lymph node measuring 2.1 cm and retrocaval lymph node measuring 1.6 cm were seen. A soft tissue density surrounding the right common iliac vessels likely representing confluent adenopathy was seen. His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 67%; right ventricle systolic pressure was estimated to be 44 mm Hg. Pericardium was normal without any pericardial effusion. There was no significant valvular abnormality.\nInitially, the patients EKG showed 2nd degree Mobitz type I block which later progressed to complete heart block. Patient was given atropine without improvement; hence, a temporary pacemaker was inserted. He was started on IV hydration and IV antibiotics and all his electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. His temporary pacemaker lead came out and it was removed. Subsequently he became unresponsive, was orally intubated, had four cardiac arrests, and was successfully resuscitated. Due to persistent pulmonary infiltrates he underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies which showed evidence of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). He was started on Bactrim for the treatment of PJP.

In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.\n\nWhat is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

His medications included ramipril, losartan potassium, and atorvastatin. Obstructive sleep apnea was being managed conservatively. There was a positive family history of hypertension. Of significance is the fact that he denied any recent history of NSAID intake.\nPhysical examination found a 97 kg, afebrile man with a BMI of 32.01 kg/m2 and a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg. He had mild pedal edema but the results of the other aspects of the general physical and systemic examination was normal. Laboratory results included a hemoglobin level of 15.4 g/dL (154 g/L), white blood cell count of 10,800 × 103/µL (×109/L), ESR of 55 mm, blood urea of 50 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL, estimated CCR of 50 ml/min, total cholesterol of 198 mg/dL, serum triglyceride level of 151 mg/dL, serum HDL cholesterol level of 42 mg/dL (on statin therapy), total serum protein level of 6.2 g/dL, and a serum albumin level of 2.8 g/dL. Urine was suggestive of 4+ proteinuria and the 24-h urinary protein level was 4.9 g/24 h and was positive for active sediments. The results of thyroid function tests were within the normal range and echocardiography was suggestive of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with type 1 diastolic dysfunction. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was suggestive of hepatomegaly with grade 2 fatty liver and a right kidney with a size of 12.5 cm × 6.3 cm and a left kidney of size 13 cm × 6.4 cm. Both the kidneys had normal echogenicity and had maintained their corticomedullary differentiation. Some of the special investigations have been shown in .\nKidney biopsy showed ten glomeruli, five of which showed partial to complete fibrocellular crescents []. The capillary basement membrane was thickened and wrinkled and there was a focal increase in the mesangial matrix and cellularity; no spikes could be seen. There was marked tubular atrophy, interstitial edema, and fibrosis as well as a diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrate in the interstitium. The vessels and the basement membrane were unremarkable. On immunofluorescence, glomeruli showed linear positivity for IgG (++), IgM (+), fibrinogen (+), and focal IgM and IgA deposition []. The diagnosis was crescentic glomerulonephritis with significant immune deposits.\nThe patient was started on intravenous, pulsed methyl prednisolone therapy along with oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg). The renal functions of the patient improved for a while, only to worsen within 2–3 months. Our patient also developed side effects of corticosteroid therapy. At this point, intravenous, pulsed cyclophosphamide was started.

The pain began gradually in the center of her thoracic spine at the level of T7–T8 and progressively became worse. She described the pain as a severe dull pain, constant, radiating through to the chest, up the back into the neck and down the back into both buttocks. She attempted to relieve the pain by soaking in warm water; when that was unsuccessful her family member brought her to the ED. She denied history of back pain, trauma, fever, abdominal pain, paresis, paralysis, urinary retention, or paresthesias.\nOn initial examination, the patient was uncomfortable and moaning. Vital signs were blood pressure 155/90 mm Hg, pulse rate 82 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and temperature 36.2 degrees C (97.1 F). She was mildly tender over the mid thoracic spine. Heart sounds were regular, pulses were equal in both extremities and bilaterally in the groin, and no other abnormalities of the physical exam were found.\nElectrocardiogram performed upon arrival was interpreted as normal sinus bradycardia, rate of 58 bpm, with nonspecific ST segment and T-wave changes. Laboratory evaluation revealed hemoglobin 13.6 g/dL (12.0 to 15.3 g/dL), WBC 11.0 × 103/μL (4.0 to 11.0), platelet count 286 × 103 /μL (150 to 450 × 103 μ/L), sodium 141 mmol/L (135–145 mmol/L), potassium 3.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), chloride 106 mmol/L (98 – 109 mmol/L), bicarbonate 29 mmol/L (23 to 31 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen 13 mg/dL (6 to 26 mg/dL), creatinine 0.83 mg/dL (0.5 to 1.20 mg/dL), and glucose 120 mg/dL (70 – 99 mg/dL). Troponin level was <0.01 ng/mL (<0.01 ng/mL = Expected range for 99% population), myoglobin was 7534 ng/mL (28 – 72 mg/mL) and creatine kinase 2336 IU/L (24 – 170 IU/L). Urinalysis revealed large blood by dipstick with 31 to 50 RBCs (patient was menstruating), negative results for nitrite and leukocyte esterase. Urine toxicology was negative for illicit drugs, and the urine pregnancy test was negative. Chest radiograph was negative for any lung pathology, mediastinum was normal width and no pathology was seen on the thoracic vertebrae. Computed tomography angiogram of the chest was normal; no aortic dissection was found.\nAn intravenous catheter was inserted when blood was drawn for laboratory evaluation. Hydromorphone 0.5 mg and diazepam 2.5 mg was intravenously given for pain relief and normal saline was begun at 150 ml/hour. Approximately one hour after arrival the patient complained of aching all over and then began to vomit, undigested food with no blood. She mentioned to the staff that a friend with whom she had had dinner had called her and told her that she was also ill. The patient explained that they had eaten fish that her friend had purchased at a local market and cooked for dinner. It was buffalo fish (Ictiobus).\nAfter reviewing the laboratory values, the rate of intravenous normal saline was increased to 300 ml/hour. The patient was further questioned for an etiology of the rhabdomyolysis and an ingestion of a toxin was considered. An Internet search was performed looking at buffalo fish and rhabdomyolysis, and information on Haff disease was identified. The Illinois Poison Control Center was notified. The Illinois Poison Control Center subsequently contacted the Cook County Board of Health and all buffalo fish were removed from the local market.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital for continued hydration. On day two the creatine kinase peaked at 30,549 IU/L, approximately 19 hours after arrival. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine remained normal. Creatine kinase levels began to decline, and the patient was discharged on day three.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?\n\nDelta Gap: delta_gap = anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12",

Based on her medical history and physical exam, she appeared to have a moderate form of OI.\nOn admission to the ER, no fetal heart tones were noted. CT findings revealed expanding hemoperitoneum from a possible uterine rupture. Initial assessment pointed to hypovolemic shock. On physical exam, the patient was 41 inches tall (3′5′′), weighing 37 kg, with flexed upper extremities and short, bowed legs. Airway examination revealed a short neck with limited neck extension, two-fingerbreadth thyromental distance, small mouth opening, Mallampati class 3, poor dentition and a tracheostomy scar.

Preoperative vitals and pertinent labs were as follows: temperature 97.9°, HR 110 BP 70–100/30–40, RR mid-20 s, and SpO2 99-100% on room air.\nWBC 20.9 k/μL, H/H 6.1/19.1, platelets 243 k/μL, sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 3.4 mEq/L, chloride 109 mEq/L, bicarbonate 10 mEq/L, urea nitrogen 13 mEq/L, creatinine 0.51 mg/dL, glucose 366 mg/dL, calcium 7.1 mg/dL, and lactic acid 5.7 mmol/L were found. The venous blood gas revealed pH 7.1, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 41.3 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen 38.9 mmHg, base excess −15.3 mmol/L, hemoglobin 4.6 g/dL, and glucose 214 mg/dL.\nA right femoral triple lumen catheter was emergently placed in the ER. The patient's hemodynamic status improved with normal saline resuscitation and packed red blood cells (PRBCs).\nThe patient was transported to the OR for an emergent exploratory laparotomy. On patient sign-in with the anesthesia team, OR nursing staff, and surgical team present, the patient confirmed the procedure written on the consent form, including a possible hysterectomy if it was life-threatening. She emphasized her desire to maintain fertility for future pregnancies if possible.\nThe anesthetic plan, potential complications, and the Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) status were subsequently addressed to the patient and the anesthesia team. Both the OR nursing staff and surgical staff were present for the discussion. The patient indicated her understanding and gave verbal consent for full resuscitative measures in the perioperative period. American Society for Anesthesiologist (ASA) monitors were placed and a right radial arterial line was inserted in sterile fashion in place of the noninvasive blood pressure cuff to avoid possible bony trauma. An arterial blood gas was immediately obtained.\nFiberoptic intubation was attempted to avoid possible complications from direct laryngoscopy, anticipated difficult airway, and use of succinylcholine. No sedation was given secondary to possible risk of aspiration, hemodynamic instability, and desaturation in the setting of a difficult airway. The airway was topicalized with aerosolized 4% lidocaine and a negative gag reflex was achieved. The initial fiberoptic intubation was attempted unsuccessfully via an Ovassapian airway. There was limited mouth opening, and the mouth was small as well. These features made placement of the Ovassapian airway difficult. The patient had a persistent gag reflex despite additional topicalization through an epidural catheter threaded in the bronchoscope port. A second fiberoptic attempt was made through a slit 22 F nasopharyngeal trumpet placed in the left nostril. The nares were tight and edematous. These features made it difficult to pass the bronchoscope down the correct passage to the nasopharyngeal space. Despite the distorted anatomy, the nasal fiberoptic approach proved successful. A gradual inhalational induction and maintenance with sevoflurane was instituted to avoid severe hypotension.\nThe patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the intubation process. A 14 G right external jugular intravenous line was placed. The patient remained normothermic via an upper body Bair Hugger™ and a fluid warmer. The baseline intraoperative arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed pH 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 19 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen 144 mmHg, base excess −8.1 mmol/L, lactic acid 4.2, hemoglobin 6.2 g/dL, and glucose 128 mg/dL. Upon initial surgical approach, 2 L of blood was evacuated from the abdomen. Hemostasis was obtained quickly. Aggressive resuscitation instituted at the time included 3 L of crystalloids and 4 U of PRBCs. Further exploration of the abdominal contents confirmed a ruptured uterus with an extra-uterine fetal demise.\nThe option of hysterectomy was discussed by the obstetricians and gynecologic-oncologists due to the increased risk of morbidity and mortality for this patient. The surgeons were primarily concerned about possible uterine rupture and postpartum hemorrhage in subsequent pregnancies. Secondary concerns regarding this patient included poor prenatal care and failure to obtain anesthesiology consultation prior to admission for delivery. The anesthetic consultation was felt necessary for team-based clinical management planning due to the high-risk nature of this patient's condition. In response to the considerations for hysterectomy while in the operating room, the anesthesiologist advocated for the patient's wishes, reemphasizing her desire to maintain fertility, if possible. The uterus was repaired and conserved. The patient was transported to SICU and was successfully extubated on postoperative day #1 without complications.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L.\n\nFree Water Deficit: free_water_deficit = (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1)",

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated by EMS upon arrival for pulseless electrical activity, and after eight minutes the patient achieved return of spontaneous circulation. She was subsequently intubated without the need for induction medications and transported to the emergency department (ED). Upon arrival to the ED, an initial physical exam revealed an intubated, unresponsive child with markedly diminished lung sounds bilaterally without wheezing, and an oxygen saturation of 60% on 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Additionally, respiratory therapy reported extreme difficulty with ventilation. Initial bedside chest radiographs (CXR) () were obtained and showed evidence suggestive of bilateral pneumothoraces, which in conjunction with the patient’s clinical picture prompted bilateral chest tube placement. Both returned large volumes of serous fluid, although no blood or air.\nContinuation of the primary survey revealed tachycardia at 132 beats per minute with strong and regular peripheral pulses in all extremities. There was no jugular venous distention. The abdomen was soft without masses. A limited neurologic exam revealed bilateral sluggish pupils, with the right pupil at 6 millimeters (mm) and the left pupil at 3 mm. There were no obvious signs of trauma, and no dermatologic findings.\nAfter initial stabilization, collateral history was obtained from the mother who stated the patient had been feeling tired with intermittent fevers over the prior few days, which led to a diagnosis of mild viral pneumonia by her outpatient pediatrician. Per her electronic health record, this was based on the patient’s age, gradual onset of symptoms with non-toxic appearance, and non-focal pulmonary findings on auscultation. Imaging and medications were therefore deferred, but return precautions were given should the patient’s clinical presentation worsen. With regard to her asthma, the patient had only occasionally used an inhaler for night-time coughing but otherwise had never been admitted, intubated, or prescribed oral steroids. She additionally denied any other known medical conditions, surgical history, allergies, or red flags to suggest the potential for non-accidental trauma.\nShortly thereafter, initial laboratory values resulted in a white blood cell count of 428,000 per milliliter (/mL) (4,400–12,900/mL) with a 96% blast differential, hemoglobin of 6.7 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (11.4–14.3 g/dL), and platelet count of 27,000/mL (187,000–445,000/mL). An electrolyte panel was significant for a sodium of 131 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) (135–145 mEq/L), potassium of 8.7 mEq/L (3.6–5.2 mEq/L), chloride of 102 mEq/L (102–112 mEq/L), bicarbonate of 10 mEq/L (19–26 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen of 16 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) (7–20 mg/dL), creatinine of 0.61 mg/dL (0.19–0.49 mg/dL), and a glucose of 461 mg/dL (70–140 mg/dL). An arterial blood gas resulted in a pH of 6.75 (7.35–7.45), PaCO2 of 60.6 mm/Hg (35–45 mmHg), PaO2 of 59.7 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) (75–100 mm Hg), lactate of 12.14 mEq/L (0.2–1.8 mEq/L), HCO3 of 8.3 mEq/L (19–26 mEq/L), with the FiO2 at 100%. An alveolar-arterial gradient was calculated to be in excess of 577 mmHg (estimated normal gradient for the age of this patient is 5 mmHg).\nNon-contrasted computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no evidence of intracranial abnormalities. Following the patient’s stabilization, the official read of the bedside CXR by pediatric radiology instead revealed a large mediastinal mass, manifesting features similar to that of bilateral pneumothoraces. Due to the patient’s age and concern for radiation, the patient did not receive CT of the chest as part of her initial workup. The patient was subsequently admitted for hyperleukocytosis with leukostasis and, in conjunction with hematology oncology, was started on leukapheresis and, later, induction chemotherapy. Over the course of the week, the patient’s clinical status continued to improve, and she was extubated and discharged home with a diagnosis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\nWhat is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?\n\nSerum Osmolality: sOsm = 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18)",

G., a 67-year-old housewife, got admitted to the hospital with a history of memory impairment, confusion, lethargy, generalized weakness and gait imbalance of 2 weeks duration. She did not give any history of fall or head injury. There was no history of fever, headache, cough, urinary symptoms or any focal weakness. She was hypertensive for last 20 years, which was well under control with Amlodipine (5 mg/day). Her part history revealed that she had undergone total right hip replacement 1 year back and had regular follow-up checkups with the orthopedic surgeon.\nOn examination, the patient was conscious and co- operative, oriented, but with cognitive impairment and some irrelevant talk and could not recollect recent events.\nThe other findings were as follows: BP 170/100, a febrile pulse 100/mt, RR 20/mt, chest clear. Cardiovascular examination did not reveal any abnormality. Abdomen showed no hepatosplenomegaly. Central nervous system (CNS) examination showed that there was generalized muscle weakness without any focal deficit. Jerks were normal. Planters were down.\nMRI brain showed age-related diffuse cerebral cortical atrophy. There was no infarction or space-occupying lesion.\nThe laboratory investigations revealed the following results: Hb 11.7 g/dl, total count 10,900, poly 68%, lymphocytes 27%, monocytes 3%, eosinophils 2%, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 18 mm/1 hour, urine R/E NAD, urea 42 mg/dl, creatinine 1.9 mg/dl, Na 140 mEq/l, potassium 3.5 mEq/l, FT4 1.38 ng/dl, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.80 mIU/l, cholesterol 167 mg/dl, low density lipoprotein (LDL) 96 mg/dl, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 40 mg/dl, triglyceride (TG) 154 mg/ dl, serum bilirubin 0.93 mg/dl, albumin 3.2 g/ dl, globulin 5.0 g/dl, alanine transaminase (ALT) 68 IU/l, aspartate transaminase (AST) 48 IU/l.

Echocardiography revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Ultrasound of the abdomen was normal. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest was essentially normal\nOn the 7th day of admission, repeat serum calcium revealed a level of 13.2 mg/dl. Parathormone (PTH) was 14.8 pg/ ml and vitamin D 25(OH) was 254.7 ng/ml.\nMammography results were normal.\nNeurological exam and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain ruled out any cerebral lesion. For hypercalcemia, she was investigated for any occult malignancy which was ruled out., She was treated with intravenous fluid, diuretics and glucocorticoid and was improving clinically. On the 7th day, a follow-up prescription from orthopedic surgeon revealed that she received inj. Arachitol 6 lacs IU intramuscularly, every week for the last 4 months On the 9th day of admission, her serum vitamin D 25(OH) was detected to be high and a diagnosis of hypervitaminosis D leading to hypercalcemia was considered. She was improving clinically and her serum calcium came down to normal in the next 2 weeks and was discharged with prescription of antihypertensive and with the advice to take food with no vitamin D and calcium. She continued to have high vitamin D level even after 4 months of discharge [vitamin D 25(OH) 215.52 ng/ml] which came down to normal (66.67 ng/ml) 6 months after discharge from the hospital.\nAt present, she is completely asymptomatic.

The pain was progressive and worsened to 10 out of 10 on the pain scale. It aggravated with movement and on weight bearing. There were no alleviating factors. She denied any recent history of trauma to her leg, chest pain, shortness of breath or any history of prolonged immobilization.\nHer past medical history included morbid obesity with a Basal Metabolic Index (BMI) of 85. She also has a history of hypertension, lymphedema, hypersensitivity lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her past medical records showed a previous hospitalization for group G and beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia three years ago that was properly treated.\nHer family history included hypertension in her father and type two diabetes mellitus in her mother. She denied any consumption of alcoholic and tobacco products or any recreational drug use.\nPhysical examination showed a morbidly obese patient with a temperature of 101.4 F. Her heart rate was 120 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 33 per minute. Her oxygen saturation at normal air was 91%. Bilateral non-pitting lymphedema in both lower extremities was observed. Her left lower extremity showed erythema and swelling in her calf region with significant serosanguinous discharge. She had a restricted range of motion in her left lower extremity.\nThe patient was admitted for further investigations. Her complete blood count showed significant leukocytosis of 25,600 cells/mm3 with bandemia, elevated procalcitonin (PCT) levels of 8.33 ng/mL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 348.0 mg/L suggesting an acute infectious process. Her creatinine level was elevated at 1.22 mg/dL compared to her previous laboratory results of 0.8-0.9 mg/dL. She also showed signs of liver dysfunction with an elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 56 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 144 U/L, and of coagulopathy with an international normalized ratio (INR) at 1.21.\nLeft lower extremity Doppler ultrasound showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis with limited evaluation for popliteal vein compression due to edema. There was Doppler flow within the popliteal vein. Significant edema was identified in the left popliteal fossa without any underlying abscess. Two separate blood cultures were tested positive for Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae. The urine cultures grew no organisms.\nThe patient was administered a loading dose of Vancomycin in the emergency department and later started on Cefepime. Proper fluid hydration was included in her treatment plans. She was then shifted to Ceftriaxone when her blood cultures came back positive for SDSD. A transesophageal echo was ordered to rule out endocarditis and came back negative for vegetations. Her condition improved slowly as her white blood cell count went from 26,000 cells/mm3 to 14,000 cells/mm3 and other inflammatory markers such as PCT were back to normal. The pain, erythema, and edema in her left lower extremity also improved gradually.\nShe was discharged after one week of inpatient treatment at her own request and prescribed another one week of ceftriaxone that she received intravenously at her home.

She denied a history of smoking or drinking. She was taking valsartan (320 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (75 mg/day), methyldopa (1,500 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg/day), spironolactone (25 mg/day), and levothyroxine sodium (300 µg/day) at initial consultation. She was intolerant to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors because of cough and amlodipine due to lower-limb edema. The patient told us that she was taking all the medications correctly. The degree of adherence was determined using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS8) translated into Brazilian Portuguese, and the patient was considered to have high adherence (eight points) on this test.\nHer physical examination revealed BP 230/160 mmHg (mean of three measures) in both arms, heart rate 80 bpm, body mass index 29.3 kg/m2, and waist circumference 94 cm. The BP measure in the lower limbs did not show a significant difference in relation to upper limbs. She had no abnormalities of the heart, lungs, or abdomen. According to initial complementary exams, the patient presented fasting glycemia 101 mg/dL, sodium 142 mEq/L, potassium 4.4 mEq/L, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI) 89.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, normal routine urine, microalbuminuria 230 mg/24 h (normal <30 mg/24 h), total cholesterol 148 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol 86 mg/dL, and triglycerides 122 mg/dL. The 24-hour urinary sodium measure was 164 mEq/L (ideal level <100 mEq/L). Other exam results were thyroid-stimulating hormone 40.89 mU/L, free T4 0.75 ng/dL, parathyroid hormone 58.86 pg/mL (normal 10–65 pg/mL), vitamin D 30.8 ng/mL, and serum calcium 9.2 mg/dL (normal 8–10 mg/dL).\nElectrocardiography was normal, with sinus rhythm and heart rate of 74 bpm. Echocardiography showed structural and functional normality. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) revealed 24-hour mean BP of 204/130 mmHg, awake BP of 207/133 mmHg, and 193/122 mmHg BP during sleep, with attenuated nocturnal dipping in systolic and diastolic BP. The patient had hypertensive retinopathy (grade 2 Keith–Wagener–Barker classification). All investigations for secondary hypertension were negative. Therefore, primary hyperaldosteronism, renovascular hypertension, renal disease, obstructive sleep apnea, pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, and Cushing’s disease were excluded, as shown in . Four weeks prior to investigation for hyperaldosteronism, her thiazide diuretic, renin–angiotensin system blocker, and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist were stopped for screening this condition, in accordance with guidelines.\nDuring outpatient follow-up, hydrochlorothiazide was exchanged for chlorthalidone (25 mg/day), and nitrendipine (20 mg/day) was added to her antihypertensive treatment. Nevertheless, the patient had several BP elevations of up to 290/180 mmHg and a hospital admission with hypertensive encephalopathy, even with the use of valsartan (320 mg/day), chlortalidone (25 mg/day), nitrendipine (20 mg/day), methyldopa (1,500 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg/day), and spironolactone (150 mg/day). Moreover, she was also using diazepam (10 mg/day) and levothyroxine sodium (300 µg/day). On hospital discharge, methyldopa was exchanged for clonidine (600 µg/day), and hydralazine (150 mg/day) was added to the therapy regimen.\nA careful interview and investigation of nonadherence was performed, and given that the patient stated that she had taken all the prescribed medications, a hypothesis of intestinal absorption disturbance was arrived at as the cause of the lack of control of hypertension and thyroid function. However, all functional, anatomic, and histopathologic investigation for malabsorption syndromes gave negative results (upper digestive endoscopy and colonoscopy, both with normal biopsies, antitissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG antibodies and antigliadin IgA antibodies were nonreagents upon testing for celiac disease).\nConsidering the difficulty in controlling the hypertension and due to the high cardiovascular risk presented by the patient (target-organ damage), the team opted to hospitalize her for the purpose of observing her evolution and performing other investigations. The usual biochemical tests were normal. She maintained her previous weight. During the hospitalization, there was a progressive control of BP levels around the fifth day of admission with administration of the same drugs previously used by the patient (valsartan 320 mg/day, chlortalidone 25 mg/day, nitrendipine 20 mg/day, atenolol 100 mg/day, clonidine (600 µg/day, hydralazine (150 mg/day, and spironolactone 150 mg/day); ). She was discharged after 10 days with controlled BP. The patient was referred for psychiatric evaluation, where she was diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder and medicated. Subsequently, she was referred for follow-up with psychology.

On arrival at our emergency department, vital signs were blood pressure of 128/81mmHg, heart rate of 75 beat/min, respiration rate of 20/min, and body temperature of 37.3℃. Her consciousness was clear but she complained of generalized weakness. The complete blood counts showed hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL, WBC 10,000 cells/µL, and platelet 196,000/µL. The results of her blood chemistry were as follows: Aspartate transaminase 11 IU/L, Alanine transaminase 9 IU/L, total protein 6.4 g/dL, albumin 4.5 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 5.2mg/dL, and creatinine 0.57mg/dL.

            "input": "A 31-year-old female patient was referred by her orthodontist to Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea for treatment of facial asymmetry and prognathism. The patient had never been diagnosed with a medical problem and had no previous history of fracture. Clinical examination revealed that the patient was slightly short in height (153.4 cm) and moderately overweight (62.4 kg, body mass index [BMI] 26.52 kg/m2). Examination of her facial features revealed a long lower face with vertical maxillary excess and mandibular asymmetry with occlusal canting of the maxilla. In addition, she had upper lip protrusion and lip incompetence.(, ) The intraoral findings included Class III malocclusion with an open bite. She had normal tooth structure and received proper dental care. Therefore, her periodontal health and oral hygiene were good.\nAfter the initial interview, the patient was referred to an orthodontist for leveling and alignment of the teeth, and treatment continued for approximately one year. After the presurgical orthodontic treatment, a clinical evaluation was repeated, and cephalometric radiographs and face bow recordings were obtained for final surgical planning 4 weeks prior to the surgery.\nIn addition, a work-up for general anesthesia and surgery was performed, and the preoperative hematologic examination, electrocardiogram and chest radiograph were unremarkable.\nThe surgery included bimaxillary procedures. Le Fort I osteotomy with midline correction, canting correction, posterior impaction, and setback movement of the maxilla were performed via rigid skeletal fixation. Bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomies were performed with a setback movement via the hybrid fixation technique (with one miniplate and one additional bicortical screw). On the left side, a greenstick fracture occurred in the proximal segment. However, we could appropriately position the proximal and distal segments as planned, and so two additional bicortical screws were used to fix the fractured proximal segment. Two closed suction drains were inserted into the mandibular surgical site. The operation was completed without major bleeding, and the estimated blood loss during the surgery was 200 mL.\nAbnormal edema and ecchymosis were observed from the second postoperative day.() At first, an improperly functioning closed suction drain was suspected, but the ecchymosis and edema appeared to be bilateral, decreasing the likelihood of drain malfunction. On the second postoperative day, drain removal and maxilla-mandibular fixation (MMF) with elastic ring were routinely performed. Normally, an orthognathic surgical patient is hospitalized for 2 nights and 3 days after surgery, but in this case, the discharge was delayed due to the appearance of abnormal ecchymosis and edema. On the fifth postoperative day, nasal bleeding and transient blood pressure lowering were noted, but the problems resolved after nasal packing and administration of intravenous fluids. At 6 days postoperatively, the patient was stable, and she was discharged from the hospital.\nMMF was routinely stopped 2 weeks after surgery, and training elastics were applied. No other complications were observed. However, the ecchymosis persisted for 6 weeks, and although it dissipated slowly and spontaneously, no specific treatment was needed for its resolution. The follow-up examination at postoperative 3 months showed uneventful healing.\nDuring the search for the cause of unexpected postoperative bleeding, she recounted multiple fractures of the lower limbs during childhood, and blue sclera was noticed. Furthermore, her familial history included multiple bone fractures in her mother, grandmother, and cousin. Therefore, OI type I was suspected, and it was inferred that the patient's complications were ultimately caused by bleeding due to vessel fragility from OI.\nThe postsurgical orthodontic treatment began one month after surgery. The molar and canine relation became Class I, and the open bite was greatly improved. After approximately eight months, debonding was done. The long lower face with vertical maxillary excess and mandibular asymmetry with occlusal canting of the maxilla were greatly improved. The upper lip protrusion and lip incompetence were also improved.(, )\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?\n\nAdjusted Body Weight: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg))",

Her grandmother had pulmonary tuberculosis 15 months prior to the onset of symptoms. The family sought medical advice first in a local hospital where investigations revealed bilateral pneumonia, left-sided pleural effusion, and bilateral pulmonary nodules. There was a history of animal contact but no raw milk ingestion. She had normal bowel habits with no jaundice, dysphagia or any other GI symptoms. She had no neurological, rheumatological, ophthalmologic, or dermatological symptoms. Physical examination revealed a pale girl, at 10th percentile for weight and height, and hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory examination was remarkable for anemia (hemoglobin 7.9 g/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 120 mm/h, and an alanine aminotransferase of 75 U/L (normal, 0-35 U/L), serum calcium 2.6 mmol/L, and low albumin level 31 g/L. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed hepatosplenomegaly and hypodense nonenhancing lesions throughout the liver (variable in size from a few millimeters to 3 centimeters), and multiple enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Chest CT scan showed basal and peripheral nodular opacities. Tests for mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) including tuberculin skin test and serum QuantiFERON showed negative results. Liver biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas []. In light of the strong epidemiological exposure, antituberculous medications were initiated (combination of isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and refampicin). Despite compliance with treatment and proper dosing, the patient persisted to be febrile with further weight loss.\nThree months later, the patient presented with repeated episodes of hematemesis and epigastric pain. Upper endoscopy revealed an erosive, hemorrhagic, nodular gastric mucosa over the entire stomach []. Histopathology of biopsies revealed chronic noncaseating granulomatous inflammation and tests for MTB, and fungal infection on the gastric biopsies were negative. Tests for antibodies associated with inflammatory bowel disease (perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antiouter membrane protein C, and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae IgA and IgG) showed negative results. Oxidative burst test for chronic granulomatous disease was negative. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 45 U/L (normal, 29-110 U/L).\nGiven the multisystem involvement with significant chest findings, tissue findings of granulomatous disease from the liver and upper GIT, together with exclusion of other causes of granulomatous inflammation, the patient was diagnosed with active disseminated sarcoidosis, and intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day) and omeprazole were started. Ten days after steroid therapy, a repeat of upper endoscopy showed dramatic improvement in the esophageal and gastric appearance [], and a colonoscopy showed no colonic involvement and normal terminal ileum. Biopsies from the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum showed dramatic reduction in the inflammation and disappearance of the granulomatous changes. The corticosteroids were tapered over 3 months. At 6 months after diagnosis, chest and abdomen CT showed resolution of the hepatosplenomegaly, and clearance of the hypodense lesions.

After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.\nOn presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.\nThe patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.\nFurther laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.\nDue to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).\nDischarged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management.

Initial blood work before fluid resuscitation showed Hg 10.3 g/dL; WBC 13.9 K/mcL; Platelets 164 K/mcL; Na 133 mEq/L; K 3.1 mEq/L; Cl 110 mEq/L; HCO3−1 mEq/L; BUN of 23 mg/dL; Cr 3.2 mg/dL; Plasma Glucose 103 mg/dL; Total Protein 5.0 g/dL; Albumin 2.6 g/dL; Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) 737 U/L; Alanine Aminotransferase (ALA) 399 U/L; Alkaline Phosphatase (ALK) 99 U/L; Total Bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL; Direct Bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL; Calcium 7.3 mg/dL; Magnesium1.5 mg/dL; Inorganic Phosphorus 2.5 mg/dL; Procalcitonin 59.11 ng/mL; Lactic Acid 1.7 mmol/L; PT 17.7 SEC/INR 1.46; aPTT 49.2 SEC; COVID-19 PCR negative; SARS-CoV-2-IgG negative; Influenza Type A negative; Influenza Type B negative; Venous blood gas: pH 7.24, pCO2 of 24 mmHg ().\nAdditional diagnostic evaluations included the following:Electrocardiogram: normal sinus rhythm with premature ventricular contractions, heart rate of 94 beats per minute CXR: no focal consolidation or pleural effusion Computed tomography abdomen/pelvis w/o contrast: perinephric stranding and cholestasis Computed tomography head w/o contrast: no new acute intracranial abnormality or mass effect UA w/electrolytes: few white blood cells and red blood cells but no casts, urinary pH of 7.5, urine anion gap of 40, and fractional excretion of sodium of 0.6%\nThe patient underwent prophylactic right femur nailing with excision of a metastatic lesion and developed a fever of unknown origin, hypotension, acute blood loss, and acute tubular necrosis two weeks before presentation. At that time, she completed treatment with vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole due to a penicillin allergy. However, the infectious workup remained negative throughout the admission. The patient remained afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and safely discharged to a subacute rehabilitation facility.\nFour days after discharge, she presented to our emergency department for fever and hypotension. The team initiated the sepsis protocol, and the patient was adequately fluid resuscitated with an appropriate blood pressure response. Blood cultures were collected, and the patient received empiric antibiotic treatment and stress dose hydrocortisone with improvement in her mental status.\nThroughout the hospital course, her functional status improved significantly. The patient again agreed to placement in a subacute rehab facility on day fourteen of hospitalization.\nThe clinical picture was suggestive of sepsis with multiorgan failure in the setting of a new RTA. The patient continued on antibiotics, maintenance fluids with lactated ringers, started on a sodium bicarbonate drip, and was admitted to the medical oncology service for further management. Working differential diagnoses included sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, antimicrobial toxicity, and immunotherapy adverse effects.\nThe patient completed a seven-day course of antibiotics. Infectious workup, including computed tomography abdominal and pelvis w/o contrast, urine culture, blood cultures, chest x-ray, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), was unremarkable. While tapering the stress dose hydrocortisone, the patient developed transient hypotension, fever, and transaminitis episodes. Per discussion with the infectious disease team and primary oncologist, the thought was that the clinical presentation was likely related to immunotherapy.\nDespite the acute renal failure resolution, the patient remained with a severe hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (HCO3−1, the nadir of 9 mmol/L), along with persistent hypokalemia (the nadir of 2.4 mEq/L) indicating a distal (type-I) RTA.\nAlthough possible, antimicrobial-induced RTA was unlikely due to the resolution of the renal failure and that none of the agents are known culprits to manifest acid/base disturbances []. Giving rise to a suspected immunotherapy-induced RTA, the patient was started on prednisone one mg/kg and transitioned to sodium bicarbonate tablets. Repeat blood work revealed an appropriate response with downtrending liver enzymes and increased serum sodium bicarbonate, indicating a resolving RTA.\nFurther workup revealed a negative autoimmune panel (anti-Ro (SS-A), anti-La (SS-B), ANA). SPEP, UPEP, free light chains, hepatitis serology, and thyroid function tests were unremarkable. Alkaline urine, a positive urinary anion gap, a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with low serum bicarbonate, and persistent hypokalemia suggested a distal-type-1 RTA.\nThe patient followed up with nephrology and oncology as an outpatient. She completed a prednisone taper over four weeks and denied symptoms at the follow-up encounter.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Anion Gap: albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL))",

His blood examination revealed anemia, leukocytosis, and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patient's serum creatinine was found to be raised (1.9 mg%, normal up to 1.4 mg%). His chest X-ray was normal. He was found to have multiple calculi in left kidney on ultrasonography (USG). USG also demonstrated multiple hypo echoic masses; thinned out parenchyma; and a dilated collecting system suggesting a chronically obstructed kidney. Suspicion of pyelonephritis was raised in the USG report and rest of the abdominal organs were unremarkable. Urinalysis showed pyuria and Escherichia coli was detected in urine culture. Antibiotic therapy was instituted for treatment of the urinary tract infection. Even after extensive antibiotic therapy, the fever remained unresolved and weight loss continued. Before invasive diagnosis, patient was referred for a whole body 18-FDG PET/CT to confirm kidney as the sole site of active disease and rule out any extra-renal pathology as the cause of symptoms.\nFor PET/CT, 10 mCi of FDG was injected intravenously to patient after 6 h of fasting. After 1 h of injection, patient was scanned on dedicated 16 slice PET – CT (GE – STE 16). Whole body CT scan was obtained as part of PET/CT protocol on a multi-slice CT with 3.5 mm slice thickness without contrast injection. Contrast administration was withheld considering the increased serum creatinine level. Standardized uptake value (SUV) of FDG was normalized to body weight obtained over lesions.\nThe maximum intensity projection (MIP) image [Figures and , arrows] revealed intense FDG uptake in cortex of grossly enlarged hydronephrotic left kidney. SUV max of uptake was 14.1. Multiple calculi were seen in pelviureteric junction and in pelvi-calyceal system [Figure red arrows]. Extensive perinephric fat stranding and mild FDG uptake in perinephric, retroperitoneal lymph nodes was seen with SUV max of 4.1 [Figure and white arrows]. The findings were reported as possible XGNP. In addition to these findings diffuse FDG uptake was seen in bone marrow [black arrow in ]. This could be due to anemia or the pyrexic state. Left nephrectomy was performed and histopathology confirmed XGNP.

            "input": "We present a 15-year-old boy who was admitted to our hospital with significant weight loss, malaise, and cold intolerance. Written informed consent for presentation was obtained from the patient and his parents.\nThe patient weighed 102 kg until four years ago, at which time, with the help of a dietitian, he started to lose weight. However, after losing 2 kg, he discontinued the dietary regime. Two years later, when he weighed 100 kg, he decided to lose weight again because he felt uncomfortable with the way he looked and felt very overweight. Within a year, he lost 20 kg by eating less and playing basketball every day for approximately two hours a day. At that time, he had to quit basketball due to a busy school schedule which led to a fear of gaining weight, causing him to restrict his diet even more. By restricting his daily intake to 500 kcal, he had lost 17.5 kg within the last two months before presenting to our clinic. The patient denied having body image problems but agreed that he had an intense fear of gaining weight. Past medical history was unremarkable except for an appendectomy performed when he was 7 years old. The family history revealed that two of his aunts have Hashimoto thyroiditis.\nAt admission, the patient’s body weight was 60.7 kg (50-75th percentile). Height was 186 cm (>97th percentile) and body mass index was 17.55 kg/m2 (<3rd percentile). His body temperature was 36.1 °C and respiratory rate was 22/min. His supine blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and heart rate was 40 bpm. His standing blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg and heart rate was 66 bpm. Cardiac examination was normal except for the bradycardia, and other systems were also normal on his physical examination. Meeting the diagnostic criteria of the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV), he was diagnosed with AN-restrictive type and hospitalized due to bradycardia. His laboratory investigations which included complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, glucose and electrolyte levels, sedimentation rate, cortisol, cholesterol levels, and urinary analysis were all within normal ranges. Thyroid function tests revealed very low TSH levels (0.025 uIU/mL, normal range: 0.27-4.20 uIU/mL), low free T3 (fT3) levels (2.87 pmol/L, normal range 3.10-6.70 pmol/L), and normal free T4 (fT4) levels (21.9 pmol/L, normal range: 12.00-22.00 pmol/L). Thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies were high, while TSH receptor antibodies were negative. With these findings, he was additionally diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Thyroid ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis.\nIn the inpatient unit, the patient was followed by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a child and adolescent psychiatrist, an adolescent medicine specialist, a pediatric endocrinologist, and a dietitian with special training and experience in adolescent EDs. During his three-week stay, he gained 4 kg. Despite the weight gain and the improvement in his nutritional status, bradycardia continued (40-50 bpm). Echocardiography findings were normal, and Holter monitoring only revealed sinus bradycardia. Thyroid functions were monitored closely without any medical treatment, along with his vitals. Before discharge, while TSH levels were still low (0.018 uIU/mL), fT3 levels were thought to be relatively high (3.76 pmol/L) considering his metabolic status. The patient was discharged with a weight of 64.7 kg. At his follow-up visit 2 months later, the boy had gained weight and weighed 75.1 kg. Due to the gradual increase noted in his TSH levels (from 8.91 to 28.84 uIU/mL), levothyroxine treatment was started. At that time, fT3 and fT4 levels were measured as 7.74 and 4.42 pmol/L, respectively. Two months later, it was learned that he had been using levothyroxine in doses three times higher than the recommended dose. Although monitored closely, due to the drug compliance problems and weight changes with severe body image issues, it was hard to maintain the thyroid levels within a stable course. Stabilization occurred after ten months of therapy when he started using a proper medication schedule and succeeded in preserving his target weight. The course of the thyroid function tests is given in . Bradycardia also improved with the recovery in thyroid hormone levels.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?\n\nIdeal Body Weight: IBW = base_weight + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60), where base_weight is 50 kg for men and 45.5 kg for women",

            "input": "A 54-year-old, overweight (BMI 29), Caucasian man with a history of tobacco smoking and gastroesophageal reflux presented to the emergency department with chest pain. He described it as sudden in onset, while he was working on his laptop. Location was substernal, radiating to his left arm and jaw. Initially, the pain was 7/10 in intensity but it improved spontaneously even before he reached the hospital or received any medications. On further probing, he reported that he had experienced intermittent episodes of chest pain for the last 3 weeks but it was mostly exertional and was relieved with rest. The pain was not associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or nausea/vomiting. He denied any fever, chills, cough, abdominal pain, urinary or bowel complaints. He did not have any family history of significant cardiac events.\nOn presentation, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 139/85 mmHg and heart rate of 81 beats per minute. His EKG did not show any ischemic changes, no left ventricular hypertrophy, or left bundle branch block. Three sets of serial troponin enzyme were less than 0.010. Lipid panel showed total cholesterol of 235, triglycerides 408, HDL 26, and LDL could not be calculated. His pretest probability of CAD was intermediate on the basis of age and sex. Since the patient was chest pain free since admission and was able to exercise, an exercise treadmill EKG stress test was ordered. The patient achieved 95% of maximum predicted heart rate and 10 METs of exercise with normalization of slight T wave inversions that were seen in leads V2, V3, and V4 at rest. Thus, it was read as maximum asymptomatic stress test with intermediate probability of ischemia. Echocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricular function and no significant valvular or wall motion abnormalities. At this point, cardiology was consulted to evaluate the patient and they recommended coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for further risk stratification.\nCCTA results showed approximate 70% stenosis of the origin of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) secondary to noncalcified plaque extending over a length of approximately 4 mm (Fig. ), approximate 40–50% stenosis of the proximal ramus intermedius branch secondary to mixed calcified and noncalcified plaque and scattered calcified and noncalcified plaque along the circumflex and obtuse marginal branches with 30–40% luminal diameter stenosis. Fractional flow reserve–computed tomography (FFR-CT) revealed a high likelihood of flow-limiting stenosis with a value of less than 0.5 secondary to the significant stenosis at the origin of the LAD and a low likelihood of flow-limiting stenosis in the left circumflex, ramus intermedius, and right coronary arteries.\nThe patient was then taken for cardiac catheterization which showed a 95% stenotic lesion of LAD with partial perfusion (TIMI grade 2 flow) giving rise to diagonal 1, which has an ostial and proximal 70% stenosis; ramus intermedius with proximal 70% segmental stenosis; circumflex, nondominant vessel, which has mild disease in proximal distal segments, giving rise to obtuse marginal 1, which has proximal 70% stenosis. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and the patient underwent bypass graft surgery.\nThe patient did well after the surgery. He stayed in the hospital for 4 days post-op without any complaints and was discharged home in stable condition. A referral to home care was made to provide for monitoring of the patient's progress and detection of any complications during the immediate post-op period. Cardiac rehabilitation referral was also provided and the patient was instructed to follow up with a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon.\n\nWhat is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?\n\nFramingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease: For men, risk_score = 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not, and if age is greater than 70, the age variable is set to 70 within the 'age' term for the β x ln(Age) x Smoker term.

            "input": "Case 1 is a 47-year-old male who recalls gradually worsening illness starting around the age of 25 that he partially attributes to poor food choices and opioid use. By the age of 36, he recalls knowing that he had “undeniable, serious illness,” and by the age of 38, he weighed over 400 pounds and suffered from severe sleep apnea, asthma and trouble breathing, eczema, allergies, hypertension (SBP/DBP = 255/155 on 2 medications), high total cholesterol (300 mg/dL), high triglycerides (279 mg/dL), and chronic shoulder and joint pain. He had difficulty moving and completing basic activities of daily living, such as putting on his shoes. He was on a number of medications that cost him approximately USD 7680 out of pocket, annually, while his insurance company paid a total of USD 19,646 for medications in 2009 alone. In addition to seeing a physician at least once every 1–2 weeks for his various conditions, he attended monthly appointments to aspirate fluid from his knees, had multiple visits to the ER, underwent shoulder surgery, and had one ankle reconstruction surgery with a second one imminent. Around 2012, at the age of 38, he decided to pursue gastric bypass surgery; however, his physician did not clear him to undergo the procedure, due to his poor underlying health. This event, combined with the recent deaths of two close family members, is what ultimately prompted him to begin considering lifestyle changes to improve his health. Initially, his approach to change was “going one step further than the day before.” First, he forced himself to simply get up from his chair once, and then twice per day, and then he progressed to being able to go on walks and walk up the stairs. He began researching additional lifestyle changes and watched documentaries, such as Forks Over Knives, which he describes as providing an entirely new perspective on food. He adopted dietary changes that began with a green juice fast followed by calorie restrictions, reducing red meat, and changing from full to lower fat dairy. On 1 January 2013, he adopted a strict, whole-food, plant-based (WFPB) dietary pattern. Thus, what started initially as a set of small lifestyle changes ultimately fostered a completely new lifestyle approach—one where fitness and plant-based eating were the focus. Approximately 6 months into the lifestyle change, Case 1 had lost 150–200 pounds, and although he does not recall his exact numbers, his cholesterol was cut in half, and triglyceride levels were in the normal range. By 2015, his cholesterol was 112 mg/dL and triglycerides were 74 mg/dL. In just 3–4 years, he went from barely standing up from a chair to running his first marathon in May 2016; by 2017, he was completing Ironman competitions and later ran an ultra-marathon. His current laboratory values as of 20 May 2021 include a total cholesterol of 103 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 36 mg/dL, triglycerides 61 mg/dL, non-HDL cholesterol 67 mg/dL, and blood pressure 122/78. Post lifestyle change, he also notes significant improvement in his level of happiness and quality of life, specifically with respect to being able to enjoy time with his family, traveling, and gaining a new outlook on life.\nAside from the possibility of gastric bypass surgery (USD 18,000–35,000) [], Case 1 was a candidate for a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine for obstructive sleep apnea (USD 1000–3000) [] and a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) machine for pain management (approximately USD 100–500) [] prior to his lifestyle change, highlighting an approximate average savings of USD 28,800 in discreet medical costs potentially avoided. Post lifestyle change, he reports spending only USD 61 per year on medications (B12 injections), as opposed to his previous approximated average spending of USD 7600+ in annual medication costs. Pharmaceutical costs covered by his insurance company decreased from USD 19,000+ in 2009 to USD 122.24 in 2015 and 2016 combined. In addition, his grocery costs are approximately half of what they were prior to his lifestyle change.\n\nWhat is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?\n\nFramingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease: For men, risk_score = 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not, and if age is greater than 70, the age variable is set to 70 within the 'age' term for the β x ln(Age) x Smoker term.

            "input": "A 13-year-old female patient was referred to the GI outpatient department of our hospital from a pediatric clinic to undergo the esophagogastroduodenoscopy for the evaluation of recurrent vomiting that lasted for 8 days. The vomiting usually occurred in the afternoon and was bilious in nature. Although vomiting was not related to food intake, she had avoided eating because of recurrent vomiting. She also complained of nausea, boring epigastric pain and palpitation, but denied diarrhea or melena. She had lost 8 kg of weight over 4 months, and her weight was 39.4 kg (10-25 percentile) and height was 156 cm (50-75 percentile) at presentation. Past history and family history were not remarkable. She was in Tanner stage 4. Menarche occurred 6 months ago, and menstrual cycles were irregular. Physical examination revealed a dehydrated tongue, cachexic and anxious appearance. Her blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse rate was 110/min, respiratory rate was 20/min and body temperature was 36.6℃. There was no definite enlargement or palpable mass on the anterior neck, eye abnormality or lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was soft with normal bowel sound and there was no direct or rebound tenderness on the abdomen. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia. Plain abdominal X-ray showed nonspecific findings. Because she had weight loss and palpitation with anxiety, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was included in the initial laboratory test. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy at the first visit of GI outpatient department revealed mild mucosal erythema on Z-line and acute erythematous gastritis with large amount of duodenogastric reflux (). Helicobacter pylori rapid urease test was negative. She was prescribed a proton pump inhibitor, prokinetic and mucosal coating agent (sucralfate) on the basis of her endoscopic diagnosis with GI department follow up after 2 weeks. Her vomiting improved during the first 2 days after medication, however, she visited the emergency department (ED) 5 days later because of recurred vomiting and boring epigastric pain. Her blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg, pulse rate was 88/min, respiratory rate was 20/min and body temperature was 36.8℃. Physical examination revealed mild epigastric direct tenderness. The physician of the ED found that she already had blood tests including TSH at GI outpatient department and it revealed TSH < 0.01 µIU/mL (normal range 0.35-5.55 µIU/mL). Complete blood count with differential, electrolyte and glucose were within normal limit. A liver function tests showed albumin 4.34 g/dL (normal range 3.8-5.3 g/dL), total bilirubin 2.47 mg/dL (normal range 0.3-1.2 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 139 IU/L (normal range 25-100 IU/L), AST 30 IU/L (normal range 0-35 IU/L) and ALT 38 IU/L (normal range 0-35 IU/L). A repeated liver function test at ED showed total bilirubin 1.7 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 133 IU/L, AST 30 IU/L, ALT 42 IU/L and magnesium and calcium were within normal limit. Subsequent blood tests for the thyroid showed free triiodothyroxine (T3) > 8.0 ng/mL (normal range 0.60-1.81 ng/mL), free thyroxine (T4) > 12.0 ng/dL (normal range 0.89-1.76 ng/dL), TSH receptor antibody 37.4% (normal range ≤ 15.0%), anti-thyroid microsomal antibody 6.22 U/mL (normal range ≤ 3.0 U/mL) and thyroglobulin antibody 6.91 U/mL (normal range ≤ 3.0 U/mL). Thyroid ultrasonography revealed diffusely enlarged glands, decreased parenchymal echogenecity and increased vascularity of both glands (). Treatment was initiated with propylthiouracil (PTU) 3.75mg/kg/day and propranolol 1 mg/kg/day, after 4 days of treatment, vomiting, epigastric pain and palpitation were improved remarkably. She was discharged with a maintenance dose of PTU (3.75 mg/kg/day) without prokinetic or proton pump inhibitor.\nShe was hospitalized again 5 days later because vomiting had recurred. Liver function tests returned to normal limits, but thyroid function tests were still elevated (TSH < 0.01 µIU/mL, free T3 6.31 ng/mL and free T4 5.09 ng/dL). We switched treatment from PTU to methimazole 0.4 mg/kg/day and added inorganic iodine (Lugol's solution) for 5 days to prevent thyroid hormone release. After 3 days, there was no further vomiting, and free T3 and free T4 were decreased to 4.46 ng/mL and 2.24 ng/dL, respectively. She was discharged with a maintenance dose of methimazole (0.4 mg/kg/day) and propranolol (1 mg/kg/day).\nAfter 2 months with methimazole and propranolol maintenance therapy, her symptoms were stable and free T4 returned to normal limits (1.27 ng/dL) despite still having low level of TSH (< 0.01 µIU/mL). Over next 16 months with methimazole monotherapy, vomiting has not recurred and she became euthyroid with normalized TSH receptor antibody.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?\n\nIdeal Body Weight: IBW = base_weight + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60), where base_weight is 50 kg for men and 45.5 kg for women",

            "input": "A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.\nOn initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.\nThe patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.\nSix months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Anion Gap: albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL))",

The pain initially began four years prior, was mild, and was triggered by walking one-half to one mile. The pain progressed and is now triggered by walking one block and relieved by several minutes of rest. He delayed medical evaluation, because he believed he was having muscle cramps. He denied any history of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, skin discoloration, trauma, or prenatal/birth complications. He had no personal or family history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, deep vein thrombosis, hypercoagulability, malignant neoplasms, or autoimmune disorders. The family history was also negative for PAD and myocardial infarction. He was taking no medications at the time of evaluation. He does not consume alcohol and has never smoked cigarettes or used illicit drugs.\nPhysical examination revealed a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, left brachial blood pressure of 114/74 mmHg, and body mass index of 25.1 kg/m2. Lower extremities showed no pigment changes, edema, tenderness, and had full range of motion. The right femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial pulses were palpable 2+. The left femoral artery was palpable 1+. The left popliteal, posterior tibial, and bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses were nonpalpable. The left popliteal and posterior tibial arteries had a weak, biphasic Doppler signal and the bilateral dorsalis pedis arteries had no appreciable Doppler signal. No carotid or abdominal bruits were noted, and the remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable. Laboratory values were within the normal range: total cholesterol 161 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein 58 mg/dL, triglycerides 52 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein 90 mg/dL, hemoglobin (Hb) 16.1 g/dL, platelet 218,000/uL, creatinine 0.79 mg/dL, glucose 80 mg/dL, HbA1c 5.2%, prothrombin time 12.8 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.0. Left ABI was 0.76 at rest and 0.40 after five minutes of exercise. Arterial duplex demonstrated biphasic waveforms from the left common and profunda femoris arteries with no stenosis. The left superficial femoral artery had bi/monophasic waveforms with >75% stenosis at the proximal thigh. The popliteal and tibial arteries had bi/monophasic flow without stenosis. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram with contrast and bilateral lower extremity runoff demonstrated normal arteries of the abdomen and right lower extremity (Figure -C). The left common femoral artery was significantly smaller than the right but otherwise normal. The left proximal to mid superficial femoral artery was severely diseased with extensive calcifications causing near-complete occlusion with distal reconstitution (Figure -C). The left proximal profunda femoris artery was completely occluded with lack of flow for the first 45 mm with distal reconstitution (Figure -F). The left popliteal, tibial, peroneal, and dorsalis pedis arteries were normal with excellent runoff. There were no signs of embryological abnormalities.\nSurgical exploration confirmed that the left common femoral artery was diminutive but soft with a palpable pulse. The origin of the profunda femoris artery was obstructed with a smooth, hard lesion (Figure ), which was removed with local endarterectomy and confirmed by pathology as a calcified plaque. The distal profunda femoris was followed and was found to be extensively full of the calcified plaque with no back bleeding, so a profundaplasty or complete profundal bypass was decided against, and a bovine pericardial patch was placed. Next, the left great saphenous vein was harvested and used for a left femoral to left above-knee popliteal artery bypass. A 2+ palpable pulse was noted in both the graft and the left above-knee popliteal artery. A 1+ weak pulse was noted at the left posterior tibial artery. The patient recovered excellently, beginning to walk in the unit by the next morning, and was discharged later that evening. Doppler on follow-up two weeks later demonstrated continued patency of the bypass graft and improvement in symptoms. His consent was obtained for publication of this report.\n\nWhat is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans showed multiple consolidation and ground glass opacities in both lung fields (). The patient was initially diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis as a result of severe pneumonia. An immediate hydration and insulin therapy were started, and dose-adjusted piperacillin and tazobactam sodium were also administered for pneumonia. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilator therapy. The ketoacidosis had improved with hydration and insulin therapy, but on the second day of hospitalization, diuretic-resistant pulmonary edema developed and continuous renal replacement therapy was started. Klebsiella pneumonia was identified in sputum cultures. After 8 days of treatment, the lung lesions had regressed (). The patient was finally moved to the general ward. However, on the 5th day in the general ward, he started complaining of vague abdominal pain. His pain had aggravated with severe tenderness. An erect abdominal X-ray showed gaseous distention of small bowel loops with suspicious stepladder sign, suggesting mechanical obstruction (). Subsequent abdominal CT suggested multiple perforation of the transverse colon with panperitonitis ().\nAn emergency laparotomy was performed. Necrotic intestines were observed from the distal ascending colon to the proximal transverse colon. Necrotic portions were resected and the Periodic Acid Schiff and Grocott's methenamine silver staining of the resected specimen showed septated fungal hyphae with acute angle branching, suggesting aspergillus species (). The patient was finally diagnosed with colonic IA. Intravenous liposomal amphotericin-B (3 mg/kg/day) was additionally administered for 35 days.

On admission, his vital signs were normal (blood pressure 125/70 mmHg, breath rate 18/minute, heart rate 78/minute, axillary temperature 37.2°C). On neurologic examination, we found ptosis, arreflectic mydriasis and exophthalmos of the right eye, suggesting that the right oculomotor nerve was affected. The left eye opened to the Foix maneuver with normal pupil reflexes. We further found symmetric facial responses and withdrawal of both arms and legs to painful stimuli. All brainstem reflexes were patent and Hoffman-Trömner and Babinski reflexes were negative on both sides. All blood tests were normal and illicit drug and toxic profiles were negative. The laboratory test results were as follows: complete blood cell count: hemoglobin 15.3, platelets 371; cholesterol profile: cholesterol 177 mg/dl, triglycerides 296, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 35 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein 83 mg/dl, ratio of cholesterol to HDL 5.1; anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I antibodies, anticardiolipin (immunoglobin G and M), activated partial thromboplastin time, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, Factor V Leiden, activated protein C and S tests were all negative.\nAn urgent neuroimaging protocol for stroke including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance image angiography (angio-MRI) was carried out. Axial and coronal trace diffusion-weighted images obtained 20 hours after the onset of symptoms showed bilateral areas of high signal intensity compatible with thalamic infarcts restricted to both paramedian thalamic territories and right periaqueductal gray matter (Figure ). The posterior circulation was patent on the angio-MRI, including the tip of the basilar artery and both posterior cerebral arteries. Further evaluation with an aim of defining the etiology of the stroke revealed a patent foramen ovale on transesophageal echocardiography with spontaneous passage of contrast bubbles from the right auricle to the left cavities. Clot formation was found in the wall of the right auricle.\nThe state of consciousness spontaneously resolved during the third week after the ictus, although fluctuant periods of somnolence and obtundation continued. Administration of modafinil (100 mg twice a day) markedly improved his state of alertness, evidencing important neuropsychologic impairment with hyperphagia, anosognosia and emotional lability with depressive symptoms. There was improvement in the right third cranial nerve function with adequate eye opening and orthophoric condition, although bilateral limitation in vertical gaze movement was persistent.

She had hypotension treated with infusions of dopamine, dobutamine and phenylephrine. At 03:15, the patient’s hemoglobin was 3.3 g/dL, platelets 95,000/mm3 and white blood cell count 29,200/mm3. She was transfused red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate. The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. At 03:59, arterial blood showed pH 6.81, PCO2 17 mm Hg and PO2 432 mm Hg. At 05:17, glucose was 334 mg/dL (RR: 70-110 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dL (RR: 5-20 mg/dL), creatinine 1.4 mg/dL (RR: 0.5-1.4 mg/dL), sodium 142 mEq/L, potassium 5.4 mEq/L, chloride 110 mEq/L, bicarbonate 7 mEq/L, calcium 6.7 mg/dL (RR: 8.5-10.5 mg/dL), bilirubin 3 mg/dL (RR: 0.1-1.2 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 124 U/L (RR: 40-125 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 77 U/L (RR: <40 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase 125 U/L (RR: <40 U/L), and albumin 2.5 g/dL (RR: 3.5-5.5 g/dL).\nThe patient’s urine output dropped until, by 10:00, she was anuric. Line placement for dialysis was unsuccessful. The patient became hypoxemic; arterial blood, drawn at 10:05, on mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen, showed pH 7.33, PCO2 22 mm Hg and PO2 36 mm Hg. The patient had severe bleeding from the uterus. The uterus was packed, but the bleeding overwhelmed the packing within 10 minutes. At 11:00, an emergency hysterectomy was performed for uncontrollable uterine bleeding. Vaginal tears were sutured. At 11:25, the patient’s hemoglobin was 13 g/dL, white blood cell count 14,200/mm3 (26% neutrophils, 51% bands, 16% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 3% metamyelocytes) and platelets 78,000/mm3.\nTwenty minutes following surgery, the patient suffered a severe deterioration in clinical status. She began developing cardiac arrhythmias including bigeminy, junctional rhythms and ventricular tachycardia. The patient was eventually transfused 18 units of red blood cells, 12 units of platelets, 7 units of fresh frozen plasma and 24 units of cryoprecipitate. At 13:19, her hemoglobin was 14.8 g/dL, white blood cell count 16,600/mm3, platelets 88,000/mm3, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.1 (RR: 0.9-1.1), PTT 61.3 seconds and fibrinogen 150 mg/dL. At 13:24, arterial blood showed pH 7.09, PCO2 48 mm Hg and PO2 30 mm Hg, on 100% oxygen and 15 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure. The patient’s clinical condition continued to deteriorate despite heroic efforts and she died at 13:55, 13 hours and 35 minutes after the onset of dyspnea.\nAutopsy revealed numerous small pulmonary blood vessels containing squamous cells (), many surrounded by cleared space in the luminal blood, and some accompanied by small calcifications (). The squamous cells were positive on immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin AE3 (). Mucinous material was identified in scattered small pulmonary blood vessels on mucicarmine stain. Autopsy revealed many sites of hemorrhage in heart, stomach, duodenum, kidneys, bladder, vagina and pelvis, and 1000 mL of partially clotted blood in the abdominal cavity. The pleural cavities contained serous fluid, 210 mL on the left and 550 mL on the right. There was pulmonary congestion and edema, with a combined lung weight of 1080 grams. There were occasional fibrin thrombi in renal glomeruli.\nExamination of the placenta showed an intact complete 496-gram placenta with no significant abnormalities. Examination of the uterus from the hysterectomy showed decidualized endometrium and cervical foci of hemorrhage with blood vessels containing anucleate squames.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?\n\nDelta Gap: delta_gap = anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12",

The patient's medical history included diabetes, secondary to a partial pancreatectomy following a work accident, treated with insulin since 2004, posttraumatic splenectomy, anxiety-depression syndrome, and family history of Raynaud's disease, but not of kidney disease, macroscopic hematuria, kidney stones, or urinary tract infections. A laboratory work-up performed on April 5, 2012, in the context of the Raynaud's disease follow-up showed that immunologic tests and C-reactive protein (CRP) were negative and serum creatinine concentration was 91 μmol/L. His regular treatment included metformin, insulin, venlafaxine, clomipramine, and aripiprazole. Following the development of digital ulcers, nifedipine was introduced (on January 11, 2013) without any other treatment change. Within few weeks, serum creatininemia progressively increased to 169 μmol/L (April 23) and 188 μmol/L (May 29).\nOn June 11, 2013, the patient was hospitalized for renal investigations. Signs of urinary function alteration (with the exception of nocturnal pollakiuria), fever, and (present or past) extrarenal manifestations, especially cutaneous eruption and arthralgia, were not observed or reported. Body mass index was 26 kg/m2, and blood pressure was 125/70 mmHg. Physical examination found Raynaud's syndrome, but without active ulcers, cutaneous sclerosis, or trophic disorders. Cardiopulmonary auscultation and abdominal examination were normal. Urine dipstick test found protein ++, hemoglobin +, and leucocytes −. Urine electrophoresis showed proteinuria (0.41 g/g creatinine) of tubular origin (albuminuria/proteinuria ratio: 19%). The cytobacteriological urine test found 104 red blood cells without leukocyturia and negative culture. Blood analysis showed no hydroelectrolyte imbalance, normal complete blood count (specifically no hypereosinophilia), moderate increase of inflammatory markers (CRP between 12 and 31 mg/L, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia), and normal albumin levels. Immunological tests (ANA, ANCA, and anti-GBM antibody) were negative; serum complement and angiotensin converting enzyme (51 UI/L) levels were normal. Blood culture, gastric aspirates for mycobacterium testing HVB, HVC, HIV, and CMV serology were negative, whereas anti-EBV antibodies suggested a previous exposure to this virus. Abdominal ultrasound and abdominal-pelvic computed tomography did not find any abnormality.\nHistological analysis of the renal biopsy, performed on June 11, 2013, found nonnecrotic granulomatous interstitial nephropathy with epithelioid cells, some multinucleated giant cells, a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, and tubular atrophy in 20% of the kidney biopsy tissue (). There was no immunofluorescent deposit and the Ziehl-Nielsen coloration was negative. Neither vascular nor glomeruli abnormality was detected.\nNifedipine was stopped on June 11 and corticosteroid treatment (0.5 mg/kg/day) was started on June 13. Serum creatininemia rapidly decreased from 175 μmol/L (June 11) to 133 μmol/L (July 12) and then remained stable (138 μmol/L on October 4). The concentration of blood inflammatory markers decreased. Corticosteroids were progressively reduced and then stopped on October 4, 2013. Serum creatininemia further improved (115 μmol/L January 24, 2014, and 106 μmol/L on January 22, 2015).\n\nUsing the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nMDRD GFR Equation: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient, where race_coefficient is 1.212 for black patients and 1.0 for non-black parients, and gender_coefficient is 1 for men and 0.742 for women",

            "input": "An 8-year-old girl arrived at the emergency department with severe respiratory obstruction following interhospital transport. She weighed 42 kg and was 137 cm in height. Treatment for asthma that had been initiated about 1 month before had not improved her respiratory condition. She presented with marked stridor and cough, severe intercostal and subcostal chest retraction, and developed acute respiratory distress. Her parents mentioned that her respiratory condition might have been worsened by an external traumatic event at the neck that had been caused by her younger brother a few months earlier. At that time, while she had been playing with her younger brother, his elbow had bumped into her neck violently.\nOn admission, computed tomography (CT) of the neck showed that severe subglottic stenosis has developed with minimal cross-sectional diameters of 3.5 × 1.8 mm at the narrowest point (0.05 cm2) (Fig. ). Laryngoscopy revealed that her airway was almost completely obstructed by severe subglottic stenosis. Findings from other preoperative investigations including laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and electrocardiography were normal. The preoperative vital signs were blood pressure of 120/59 mmHg, temperature of 37.5 °C, respiratory rate of 20/min, and SpO2 of 98% (O2 5 L/min via mask). Because the cause of the severe subglottic stenosis was unclear and her symptoms were worsening day by day, we decided to perform emergency tracheostomy to prevent further worsening of her symptoms and a life-threatening condition.\nThe case was discussed in detail among otolaryngologists and anesthesiologists. Because we anticipated intubation to be impossible, emergency tracheostomy was planned. She was transferred to the operation room for emergency tracheostomy. Intraoperatively, the girl was monitored for oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and non-invasive blood pressure, with electrocardiography performed as well.\nWe judged that it would be difficult to obtain the patient’s cooperation with only regional anesthesia. Emergent tracheostomy was therefore planned under general anesthesia. Sevoflurane was administered with sufficient titration to maintain spontaneous breathing. Anesthesia was maintained via the inhalation of air, oxygen, and sevoflurane. We considered that the use of a face mask instead of supraglottic airway devices during anesthesia might minimize the risk of tracheal injury or laryngospasm. The lungs were fully preoxygenated. The sevoflurane concentration was increased to 3%, at which point the patient was unresponsive.\nThe patient initially continued breathing spontaneously, but ventilation later became impossible because the otolaryngologists pulled her trachea. Before the oxygenation and hemodynamics became unstable, tracheostomy was successfully performed by the otolaryngologists. The patient was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for postoperative airway management.\nOn postoperative day (POD) 3, because her airway had been stabilized by tracheostomy, she was discharged from the PICU. On POD 4, CT of the neck still showed narrowing of the subglottic portion. On POD 7, a laryngoscope under general anesthesia revealed severe edema at the subglottic stenosis (Fig. ). The otolaryngologists considered that the cause of the subglottic stenosis might be edema due to cricoid fracture, given her medical history.\nAt five months after surgery, a laryngoscope was again inserted under general anesthesia, revealing large granulomas surrounding an object in the subglottic wall. Surprisingly, this object turned out to be a circular plastic foreign body (cross-sectional diameter of 1.2 × 1.0 cm) (Fig. ). Surgery was performed to remove the object. On showing the foreign body to the patient and her parents, they did not remember her aspirating the object. She was discharged from our hospital and placed under home care after removal surgery.\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

Physical examination revealed mildly pale, icteric sclerae, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 14 cm, parotid gland enlargement and palmar erythema. Other examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory investigations on admission showed white blood cell (WBC) count 6,210/dL, hemoglobin (Hb) 5.8 g/dL, platelet count 283 × 103/dL, aspartate transaminase (AST) 116 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 73 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 192 U/L, albumin 2.7 g%, total bilirubin (TB) 5.74 mg%, direct bilirubin (DB) 5.3 mg%, prothrombin time (PT) 16.2 s (control 12.4), and international normalized ratio (INR) 1.23; serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was within normal range.\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and revealed a 3-cm large ulcer with elevated border and necrotic tissue in the antrum of stomach; no varix was seen. The tissue biopsy was performed to exclude malignant ulcer. Liver ultrasonography revealed a cirrhotic liver and diffused multiple echogenic nodules size 7–9 mm in both lobes with a large echogenic mass 3.3 cm in size with a halo.

He had been prescribed amlodipine 2.5 mg for hypertensive medication. He also underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer two years earlier. He underwent pelvic MRI using gadoterate meglumine (15 mL), immediately after iodide contrast-enhanced chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) for cancer surveillance. Thirty days before CT scan, his creatinine level was 1.28 mg/dL and his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 58 mL/min/1.73 m2. After 185 days, he visited a local clinic because of edematous changes in both lower extremities. CT angiography of the lower extremities was performed; no stenosis or occlusion of vessels was observed. Although diuretics were administered for 2 weeks, the edema worsened and was accompanied by pruritus and pain (). Eventually, he was referred to our hospital for further evaluation.\nUpon admission, his body temperature was 36.8°C and his blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. His height was 161.3 cm, weight was 53.2 kg and body mass index was 20.4 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed grade 2+ pretibial pitting edema with redness, mild heat, and tenderness in both lower extremities. Both inguinal lymph nodes were not enlarged.\nInitial laboratory findings at admission (about 210 days after MRI scan) were as follows: white blood cell count, 6,200 /μL (neutrophil 66%, lymphocyte 22%, monocyte 10.3%, eosinophil 0.5%); hemoglobin, 10.7 g/dL; platelet, 253,000 /μL; blood urea nitrogen, 41 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 2.07 mg/dL; eGFR, 32 mL/min/1.73 m2; serum sodium, 134 mmol/L; potassium, 3.4 mmol/L; chloride, 102 mmol/L; total CO2, 20 mmol/L; calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.5 mg/dL; total protein, 6.9 g/dL; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; aspartate transaminase, 43 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 15 U/L; and C-reactive protein, 0.96 mg/dL. Routine urine analysis revealed a pH of 6.0 and trace proteins. Red and white blood cells were absent in the urine. The spot urine protein/creatinine ratio was 209 mg/g and the spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio was 60 mg/g. Thyroid function tests were normal: thyroid stimulating hormone, 2.47 μIU/mL and free T4, 0.98 ng/dL. Fractional excretion of Na 0.1% and Fractional excretion of urea on admission was 17.6%, which suggested the patient was prerenal AKI.\nChest radiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. During doppler sonography of both lower extremities, the venous velocity was normal and there was no evidence of thrombosis. None of the aforementioned findings were suggestive of refractory edema.\nFluid therapy was administered to treat the AKI, which was probably caused by the diuretics he was given during his two-week stay in the local clinic. Subsequently, his renal function improved: serum creatinine, 1.18 mg/dL; and eGFR, 63.9 mL/min/1.73 m2. Since the redness and tenderness of both legs were suggestive of cellulitis-associated edema, intravenous cefazolin was administered for two weeks. However, the lesion gradually spread from his ankle to his thigh and changed into fibrotic induration. Contracture of the ankle and knee joints also occurred ().\nTo detect diffuse or localized systemic sclerosis, antinuclear antibody, anti-Scl 70 antibody, and anti-centromere antibody tests were performed, but the results were all negative. Also, eosinophilia and paraproteinemia was not seen, which is commonly accompanied in scleromyxedema or eosinophilic fasciitis. Although approximately 50 weeks had passed since he was exposed to the gadolinium, the characteristic clinical features led to the suspicion of NSF. A biopsy of the right anterior tibial skin lesion was performed to examine tissue for disease. This revealed unique features of the NSF such as dermal thickening with collagen fibers extending into the subcutaneous septa and a large number of spindle-shaped fibrocytes (). Neither eosinophilic tissue infiltration nor fat necrosis with calcification of adipocytes was found.\nSystemic methylprednisolone (20 mg/day) was administered for two weeks to treat the NSF. Additionally, UV-A1 topical phototherapy of 1.5 joule (J)/cm2 was administered to the lower leg lesion twice a week. The patient underwent intensive physical therapy including stretching, pneumatic compression, and Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation . We administered MTX 15 mg weekly while reducing the methylprednisolone dose weekly by half until a dose of 2 mg/day was administered. Simultaneously, the UV-A1 intensity was gradually increased to 3.0 J/cm2. After 6 months of treatment, the reddish edema improved and the skin induration decreased. Although the contracture of the ankles was still present (), there was no further disease progression. Currently, the patient receives MTX (10 mg) weekly and methylprednisolone (2 mg) daily.\nInformed consent for publication of clinical data was submitted by the patient and the images are published with the consent of the patient.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Anion Gap: albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL))",

ROTEM performed 2 hours after ICU admission () revealed that Patient A was hypercoagulable with the EXTEM assay showing an increased clot firmness with an amplitude of clot firmness 5 minutes after coagulation time (CT) (A5) of 65 mm and a maximum clot firmness (MCF) of 78 mm, indicating hypercoagulability with a high risk of thrombosis []. FIBTEM also showed increased clot firmness (A5 41 mm and MCF 50 mm), indicating increased fibrinogen concentration and fibrin polymerization. Furthermore, the EXTEM lysis index 60 minutes after CT (LI60) was 97%, i.e., in the physiologic range (82–97.9%), whereas FIBTEM LI60 was 100% []. Treatment consisted of continuation of antibiotics, enoxaparin 40 mg twice a day in view of ROTEM results, and high flow nasal oxygen and intermittent face mask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapies. The patient did not need intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) or any vasoactive support. Laboratory results on the second day in the ICU were as follows: Hb: 131 g/L, WBC: 10.8 × 109/L, platelet count: 307 × 109/L, INR: 1.1, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio: 1.3, D-dimer: 510 μg/L, and CRP: 196 mg/L. The patient recovered well and was transferred from the ICU to the medical ward after two days in the ICU with a CRP of 73 mg/L and was discharged three days later with a prescription of her usual medication plus enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for 2 weeks. The patient did not show any clinical signs of thrombosis during her hospital stay.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?\n\nAdjusted Body Weight: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg))",

Four months after the onset of numbness and motor weakness of the lower extremities, she presented to our hospital without any trauma. One week before presentation, the gait disorder and bladder and rectal disorder became apparent. The patient’s history included hypertension. There was no family history of acromegaly or OPLL.\nShe weighed 72 kg, her height was 162.0 cm, and her BMI was 27.4 kg/m2. Blood pressure at admission was 160/90 mmHg. Her facial appearance was acromegaly-like, with a frontal protrusion, nose and lip enlargement, and mandibular protrusion (Fig. a). We also observed thickening of the soft tissue of the palm and fingers and thickening of the Achilles tendon. There was no history of headache, sweating, or fatigue, and we did not observe Raynaud’s phenomenon or carpal tunnel syndrome.\nIn the upper extremities, no abnormal neurological findings were observed. However, weakness in both lower extremities (iliopsoas muscle MMT4, quadriceps femoris MMT4) was observed. Both lower extremity tendon reflexes were enhanced, and clonus was observed. Hypo-sensation (5/10) was observed below the umbilicus. These neurological findings suggested spinal cord lesions below the T10 level. She was barely able to walk on flat ground using two canes, and the Japanese Orthopedic Association score was 9 points (4–1–2-0-0-2).\nThe complete blood count was normal. An evaluation of glycemic status revealed a fasting plasma glucose level of 115 mg/dL. The glycosylated hemoglobin level was 5.9%, and the plasma glucose level during the OGTT (75 g glucose) at 2 h was 153 mg/dL. These results ruled out type 2 diabetes. Hepatic function tests and renal function tests revealed no abnormalities except for high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (432 IU/L). Estimations of serum electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorous were within normal limits. Hormonal evaluation showed raised serum IGF-1 (1914 ng/mL, reference range by age for IGF-I levels is 83 ~ 221 ng/mL) and GH (80.3 ng/mL) levels. GH was not suppressed with 75 g glucose loading, (after 60 min: 131 ng/mL; after 120 min: 46.9 ng/mL).\nX-ray images showed characteristic findings of acromegaly. Scalloping in some vertebrae was observed, as indicated by arrowheads on a lateral view of the lumbar X-ray in Fig. a []. On thoracic spine X-ray there were no findings of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) such as more than three successive bone bridges, and there were no anterior or posterior osteophytes with a biconcave appearance such as Erdheim spondylosis in the thoracic spine (Fig. b, c).\nOn computed tomography (CT) images of the whole spine, isolated OPLL was observed from the lower cervical vertebra to the middle thoracic vertebra. At T6/7, a beak-shaped protrusion into the spinal canal was observed (Figs. a, c).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole spine revealed stenosis with an intensity change in spinal cord at C6/7 and extensive spinal cord compression in the thoracic spine (Figs. b, d). Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain showed a mass without contrast enhancement on the right side of the anterior pituitary gland (size, 10 mm × 12 mm × 10 mm) with suprasellar and parasailer extension; the image revealed a pituitary macroadenoma (Fig. ).\nThe patient’s most remarkable symptom was paraplegia, and we diagnosed myelopathy due to thoracic OPLL. Furthermore, we suspected acromegaly because of the characteristic facial features and blood test findings (ALP 432 IU/L, GH 80.3 ng/ml, IGF-1914 ng/ml). Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain performed by the endocrinology department showed a pituitary adenoma (Fig. ). The patient’s symptoms satisfied the diagnostic criteria for acromegaly. Neurosurgery was scheduled for the pituitary adenoma, but spinal surgery was prioritized due to fear of exacerbation of neurological symptoms.\nThe neurological findings suggested spinal cord lesions below the T10 level, and T6/7 was judged to be the location of the primary lesion. T1–3 and T6–11 laminectomy and T1–11 posterior fixation were performed. Additionally, there was severe spinal cord compression in C6/7, and open-door laminoplasty with a lamina plate was performed for C5–7 (Fig. ).\nOn the third day after the operation, rehabilitation was started with a cervical collar and hard thoracolumbar corset. The postoperative course was good, the paralysis gradually improved, and the patient was able to walk alone indoors. She was discharged 3 weeks after the operation. There have been no adverse or unanticipated events. Two months after the spinal surgery, resection of the pituitary adenoma was performed in the neurosurgery department, and the patient is still under observation. A pathological image (H&E, × 400) is provided and showed a sheet of monotonous cells with round nuclei and loss of normal lobular patterns of the pituitary adenoma (Fig. ). Staining for TSH and ACTH was negative. Staining for PRL was positive in 10% of the resected pituitary tissue. Staining for CAM5.2 was diffusely positive in many cells and several cells had fibrous bodies. These findings are consistent with growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas. We did not have other antibodies, so it was difficult to classify the pituitary adenoma in detail.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?\n\nIdeal Body Weight: IBW = base_weight + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60), where base_weight is 50 kg for men and 45.5 kg for women",

Her proteinuria was not detected before March 2011 by screening test by the family doctor. At admission, her height was 153 cm, weight was 40 kg, and blood pressure was 138/70 mmHg with treatment of candesartan 8 mg/day. Physical examination showed bilateral pitting edema of her legs and palpable superficial inguinal lymphadenopathies.\nLaboratory results were as follows: serum creatinine 1.27 mg/dL; sodium 138.8 mEq/L; potassium 4.5 mEq/L; hemoglobin 14.6 g/dL; white blood cells 12,300/μL; platelet count 42,000/μL; serum total proteins 7.4 g/dL; and albumin 2.1 g/dL; total cholesterol 224 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 119 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 60 mg/dL, triglyceride 96 mg/dL. She had an antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1:40, with a speckled pattern that was associated with the presence of anti-dsDNA antibody (28 IU/mL). Tests were negative for anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SS-B, anti-SS-A, and anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies. Her CH50 level was low (14.3 U/mL). Microscopic urinalysis showed 51–100 red blood cells and 3–5 white blood cells per hyper field. Proteinuria was 9.3 g/day and selectivity index was 0.01. Chest and abdominal CT revealed no abnormalities. She was diagnosed with SLE based on thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, positive ANA with anti-dsDNA antibody, and history of photosensitivity.\nBefore renal biopsy, we decided to treat her by prednisolone (PSL) 40 mg/day to normalize platelet count. Five days after the treatment, platelet count increased to 127,000/μL. Renal biopsy was performed 7 days after the treatment. The specimen for light microscopy contained 26 glomeruli; 8 exhibited global sclerosis, 2 revealed focal endocapillary hypercellularity superimposed on several foam cells (Fig. ).\nImmunofluorescence (IF) showed low-intensity diffuse global granular capillary staining of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q. Analysis by electron microscopy (EM) revealed electron-dense glomerular basement membrane deposits and foot process effacement (Fig. ).\nThis patient would have been diagnosed as LN class III (A) + V or III (A) because of scanty subepithelial immune deposition; however, we observed focal segmental foam cells closely resembling the cellular variant of FSGS. Based on experience with FSGS from July 2011, we added cyclosporine 100 mg/day on the initiated treatment with PSL. Within 3 months, the patient’s proteinuria rapidly improved from 9.3 to 1.8 g/day, and her leg edema completely disappeared. Her CH50 level gradually increased, and her anti-dsDNA antibody titer decreased below the normal limit (Fig. ). In March 2012, we performed a kidney re-biopsy. We observed focal segmental sclerotic lesions and endocapillary foam cells. IF with IgG, C3, and C1q showed bright granular staining, and EM showed electron-dense deposits at the same site. Diffuse foot process effacement was still present (Fig. ).\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

Her past medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, restrictive lung disease, morbid obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She had no history of cancer or multiple myeloma, or renal disease as evident from past admissions.\nUpon presentation to the ED, she was found to have a serum creatinine of 5 mg/dL (her baseline was 0.5 mg/dL) and a serum calcium level of 23.1 mg/dL (normal reference range: 8-10.4 mg/dL) and ionized calcium of 3.23 mg/dL (normal reference range: 4.23-5.11 mg/dL). Her albumin was 3.9 g/dL, within normal range, indicating true hypercalcemia. CT of her abdomen and pelvis revealed an 18 mm cyst in upper pole of the right kidney with a parapelvic cyst measuring 18 mm x 18 mm (Figure ). Chest X-ray (CXR), CT of head also did not show any significant pathology. Her other labs included a white blood cell (WBC) 14.14, hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, platelet 427,000 platelets per microliter, sodium 131 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, chloride 89 mEq/L, carbon dioxide 36 mEq/L (normal reference 20-32 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 62 mg/dL, magnesium 3 mEq/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 71 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 46 IU/L, troponin 39 ng/mL, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) 435 pg/mL, international normalized ratio (INR) less than 0, and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) more than 212 s. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) showed intraventricular right bundle branch block (Figure ). Her vitals included a temperature of 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse of 72 beats/min, and blood pressure of 160 over 83 millimeters of mercury. A hypercalcemia work-up was done which included parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related protein, and serum protein electrophoresis. PTH was found to be low at 13.9 pg/mL (normal range 15-75 pg/mL) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) was less than 2 pmol/L, normal. Serum immunofixation showed no monoclonal band, and serum and urine protein electrophoresis were unremarkable. Viral hepatitis serologies were negative. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was 3.14 uIU/mL, normal. Vitamin D 25-hydroxy was normal, 50.3 ng/mL.\nTreatment was initiated with fluid resuscitation (1 L normal saline bolus), the bisphosphonate Zometa (Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Schaumburg, IL), and Miacalcin (Mylan, Rockford, IL). A temporary dialysis catheter was placed and dialysis treatment was initiated 12 h later (day two), and again on day three due to a persistently elevated serum calcium level of 11.5 mg/dL. Dialysis was necessary as Zometa and Miacalcin were not working fast enough to ensure a positive outcome alone. In addition, there was concern for acute tubular necrosis due to Zometa in our patient with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min (Figures -, Table ).

She was prescribed a course of azithromycin for presumed bronchitis. The following day, she presented to her local emergency department with acute onset of severe shortness of breath and associated chest pain. She was found to be hypotensive (90/60 mmHg), tachycardic (115 beats/min), and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a presumptive diagnosis of septic shock. Norepinephrine and empiric IV vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam were started. Initial labs revealed: white blood cell count (WBC) 12.7/μL with 77.9% neutrophils, hemoglobin 12.7 g/dl, hematocrit 39.8%, platelets 141, lactate 8.2 mmol/L, sodium (Na) 149 mmol/L, potassium (K) 4.3 mmol/L, bicarbonate 16 mmol/L, chloride (Cl) 115, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 28, creatinine (Cr) 1.3 mg/dl, blood glucose 214 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 128 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 200, alkaline phosphatase (AP) 104 IU/L, serum troponin I 12.6 ng/ml, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 339 U/L. Her electrocardiogram revealed an accelerated junctional rhythm with a rate of 115 beats/min, poor R wave progression and low voltage. An emergent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed severely impaired left ventricular (LV) function with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. Within 24 hours of presentation her condition deteriorated and she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient then was transferred to our center for further management.\nUpon arrival the patient was intubated, sedated, and afebrile. Her blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg and she had a heart rate of 110 beats/min. Examination revealed bilateral crepitations in the lungs, normal heart sounds and a benign abdomen. Her skin was mottled; and her extremities were cold and clammy. There was no pedal edema. Chest radiograph revealed diffuse bilateral patchy infiltrates and pulmonary vascular congestion. A repeat TTE demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%, normal LV and RV dimensions, moderate mitral regurgitation, left ventricle wall thickness of 12 mm, and global hypokinesis of LV with minor regional variation. There was no evidence of a pericardial effusion. Notable labs were a WBC 14.8/μL with 82% neutrophils, hematocrit 36.5%, platelets 113, CPK 365 U/L, troponin 7.6 ng/ml and Cr 0.76 mg/dl. The patient remained hypotensive despite maximum doses of norepinephrine, dobutamine and vasopressin. She was continued on empiric antibiotics and empiric oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) was added. Immediate left and right heart catheterization demonstrated normal coronary anatomy, with a cardiac index of 1.16 L/min/m2. Emergent venoarterial ECMO (flow = 4 L/min) was placed via left common femoral vein and artery.\nOn day 3 of hospitalization, pulmonary congestion significantly improved but another repeat TTE showed persistent severe LV systolic dysfunction with an EF of 15%. Endotracheal aspiration at admission returned positive for influenza B by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy was performed on hospital day 3 (total 4 specimens). Histopathology was negative for inflammation. Immunohistochemical stain for parvovirus B19, HHV6, HSV and PCR for enteroviruses, EBV and CMV were all negative. Bronchoscopy revealed mild mucosal erythema with clear secretions. The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was negative for enteroviruses, adenoviruse, CMV, EBV and HSV by PCR. Blood, BAL and urine cultures were negative for bacterial growth and empiric antimicrobials were stopped on day 5 and oseltamivir was continued for a total of 7 days.\nThe patient’s clinical status gradually improved, inotropic support was stopped and a repeat TTE on day 7 showed significant recovery of left ventricular function with an estimated EF of 50%, and ECMO support was able to be withdrawn.\nThe patient was extubated on hospital day 8; low doses of a β -blocker and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor were started. The patient’s course was complicated by a pseudoaneurysm of the left common femoral artery secondary to the ECMO therapy, which was repaired successfully. She was discharged on hospital day 15. Transthoracic echocardiography one month after discharge demonstrated normal LV systolic function with an EF of 60%, normal LV wall thickness, trace mitral regurgitation and no ventricular dilation.\nDuring the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic an association between myocarditis and influenza viruses was noted during an autopsy study []. While there have been reports of fulminant myocarditis or cardiomyopathy associated with influenza B in children, it has very rarely been reported in adults [,-]. In 1958, a group of four patients with pericarditis, subacute myocarditis, and fatal chronic myocarditis associated with influenza B were documented []. Ray CG et al. described a 34-year-old healthy woman who presented with acute onset of dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock following a few days of flu like syndrome. She had a very complicated course and died 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Influenza B virus was isolated from the nasopharynx and the diagnosis of acute myocarditis was confirmed by cardiac autopsy [].\nMcCarthy et al. described fulminant myocarditis as a distinct clinical presentation of abrupt onset of severe heart failure and cardiogenic shock preceded by a viral syndrome similar to our patient []. The typical echocardiographic findings in fulminant myocarditis are described as near normal ventricular dimensions, severely depressed LV systolic function, and increased left ventricle wall thickness []. Histological diagnosis of fulminant myocarditis can be difficult especially in the early phase of disease. The limited sensitivity of cardiac biopsy for detection of myocarditis is well recognized and negative cardiac biopsies results cannot exclude the diagnosis of myocarditis []. Myocarditis usually presents as a focal or patchy infiltration predominantly in the lateral free wall of the left ventricle and often not involving the right ventricle, therefore, biopsies taken from the right ventricle could be falsely negative [].\nThis patient’s clinical presentation of refractory cardiogenic shock 6 days after the onset of influenza and severely impaired left ventricular systolic function, and subsequent normalization of ventricular function after recovery of her viral illness; taken together with her typical echocardiogram findings in the setting of normal coronaries supports the clinical diagnosis of viral fulminant myocarditis; regardless of non diagnostic right ventricle biopsies. During influenza infection, severe myocardial dysfunction can be caused not only by direct injury to cardiac myocytes but also by overexpression of cytokines and severe inflammatory response to viral infection resulting cytokine and humoral mediated forms of myocarditis with no cellular infiltrate.\nThe reason for the unexpected severity of influenza B infection in our patient was not clear. Clinical data about risk factors and complications of influenza B are limited. Her only past medical history was remote myasthenia gravis and thymectomy over 20 years prior. The predominant circulating B strain was B/Wisconsin/1/2010- LIKE when the patient presented to the hospital, which was matched with the B component of the 2012–2013 vaccine []. We do not know if the patient had received an influenza vaccine this season. The possible lack of immunologic memory for this infection might have contributed to the severity of influenza B virus infection in our patient. Increasing awareness among patients and physicians about the importance of vaccination as the most important strategy for minimizing the severe complications of influenza infection could help to prevent similar cases in the future.\nThe treatment of influenza associated fulminant myocarditis still remains supportive. Studies have shown the early use of mechanical circulatory support for patients with fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock who fail aggressive pharmacologic treatment would increase survival rate [,]. Our patient received oseltamivir, standard heart failure treatment but more important early initiation of ECMO support before irreversible organ failure developed.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?\n\nDelta Gap: delta_gap = anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12",

Laboratory examination on admission showed serum total bilirubin level of 9.6 mg/dl. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging revealed Bismuth-Corlette type IIIB perihilar cholangiocarcinoma with left portal vein and left hepatic artery invasion, type III portal vein variation, dilated right intrahepatic bile duct, and left liver lobe atrophy (). Due to the unique location of the gallbladder and combined multiple hepatic anomalies, presence of LSGB was highly suspected (). The branching pattern of the portal vein appeared strange compared with the usual type III portal vein variation, in which the liver appeared to be divided into 3 parts; the right posterior section, the right anterior section integrated with the left medial section, and the left lateral section (). For biliary decompression, endoscopic nasobiliary drainage was performed following endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Surgery was performed when the serum total bilirubin level was 1.7 mg/dl.\nAfter dissection of the hilar structures, we recognized that the tumor was located at the imaginary hilar bile duct bifurcation, but its actual location was corresponding to the biliary confluence of the left median and lateral sections. After transecting the distal bile duct at the level of the pancreas, we found that there was no vascular invasion of the right-sided liver. Thus, the extent of liver resection included extended left lateral sectionectomy (, ). Through the anterior transection approach without the hanging maneuver, the liver was transected and the bile duct was resected en bloc. The right-sided bile duct orifice in the liver was 8 mm in size and single, and probing exploration revealed that it was the common-channel bile duct confluence of the above-mentioned three sections in the right-sided liver. The resection margin was tumor-negative on frozen-section biopsy. Since only the left-sided wall of the umbilical portion of the portal vein was partially invaded by the tumor, the involved portion was excised and then covered with a remnant branch patch after excision of a small adjacent portal vein branch in the left medial section ().\nThe caudate duct did not appear to be involved based on the preoperative imaging study findings, but the Spigelian lobe with the paracaval portion was excised to achieve maximal curability according to the general concept of surgical resection for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. One 5-mm-sized bile duct opening was exposed following caudate lobe resection, but it was directly communicating with the right-sided duct; therefore, it was closed because bilio-enteric reconstruction was not necessary. Locoregional lymph nodes were dissected from the hepatic hilum to the celiac axis because some nodes were tumor-positive on frozen-section biopsy. Biliary reconstruction was performed through a single, large hepaticojejunostomy using a Roux-en-Y limb.\nPathological examination revealed that the final diagnosis was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the liver with vascular invasion of the left hepatic artery and left portal vein, concurrent perineural invasion without lymphovascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis in 5 out of 12 nodes (). Thus, tumor staging was T3N1M0, being stage IIIB according the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.\nThe patient recovered uneventfully without any complication and was discharged 11 days after surgery. Currently, the patient is receiving concurrent chemoradiation therapy.\n\nUsing the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nMDRD GFR Equation: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient, where race_coefficient is 1.212 for black patients and 1.0 for non-black parients, and gender_coefficient is 1 for men and 0.742 for women",

            "input": "A 2-month-old 4.3 kg male child was diagnosed as extrahepatic biliary atresia and was scheduled for laparotomy. The child was brought to the pediatrics clinics 2 weeks earlier with complaints of rapid breathing since 12 days, vomiting (non bilious) since 8 days, and decreased oral intake since 1 day. The child was passing clay colored stools and dark colored urine. There was yellow discoloration of skin since 2 weeks, which was progressively increasing. The mother revealed the presence of recurrent rhinorrhoea from the first day of life.\nExamination revealed icterus. Abdomen examination showed hepatospenomegaly (liver on left side and spleen on right side) and umbilical hernia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) displayed inverted P waves in I, aVL and aVR, which were suggestive of situs inversus. Chest X-ray revealed evidence of bronchopneumonia and the cardiac shadow was on the right side. Ultrasonography abdomen also indicated situs inversus. Echocardiography was suggestive of situs inversus with dextrocardia with normal cardiac anatomy. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan was indicative of extra hepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) with the liver in left upper abdomen. Child was diagnosed as situs inversus with dextrocardia, bronchopneumonia, and extrahepatic biliary atresia.\nBronchopneumonia was managed with intravenous antibiotics, paracetamol, and steam inhalation. The child was placed on therapy with oral phenoparbitone 10 mg twice a day and intravenous Vitamin K 5 mg once a day for 10 days. Investigations revealed hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL, total leucocyte count (TLC) 17400/mm3, platelet count 4.5 lac/mm3, serum sodium 131 meq/L, serum potassium 4.4 meq/L, random blood sugar 70 mg/dL, serum bilirubin 19.2 mg/dL (normal 0.2-1.2) (direct-12, indirect 7.2), SGOT 148IU/L (normal 15-50) , SGPT 93 IU/L (normal 15-50), alkaline phosphatase 1232 IU/L (normal 50-300), blood urea 18 mg/dL (15-45), serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dL (0.6-1.2), prothrombin time (PT) 11.3 sec (test), 12 sec (control), and aPTT test 38.7 sec Control 29 sec (normal 20-40 sec). The child was listed for corrective biliary surgery.\nThe operating room was kept warm prior to shifting of the child. In the operating room, routine monitors (electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, non invasive blood pressure) were attached. Left-sided ECG leads were attached on the right side and vice versa. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous fentanyl (9 μg) and thiopentone (25 mg), and lungs were ventilated with isoflurane in oxygen and nitrous oxide (50:50) (MAC 1.2) using Jackson Rees modification of Ayre's T piece. After achieving neuromuscular blockade with atracurium (2.5 mg), trachea was intubated with endotracheal tube size 3.5 mm ID. Capnography and temperature monitoring was also initiated. Urethra was catheterized and urinary output was monitored. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane in oxygen and nitrous oxide (50:50) (MAC 1) using paediatric close circuit along with boluses of atracurium (0.5 mg) and fentanyl (1 μg) as required. The child was kept warm using warm fluids, warming mattress and by adequately covering the child with cotton.\nThe surgeon found the liver on left side with right lobe on the left side, malrotated gut (caecum, appendix on the left side), two atretic gall bladders, annular pancreas with preduodenal portal vein, cirrhotic enlarged liver, and a multi-lobulated spleen. Hepatic roux-en-y portoenterostomy with Ladd's procedure was done. The surgical incision site was infiltrated with 6 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine. The hydration was maintained using normal saline. The surgery lasted 5 hours, and blood loss of 100 mL was replaced with packed red blood cells.\nAt the end of surgery, the airway resistance increased. The airway pressures increased from 18 cm H2O to 28 cm H2O. Endotracheal tube suctioning was done. On auscultation, breath sound was reduced on the right lung fields. Repeat suction was done. We suspected a mucus plug to be obstructing the endotracheal tube and changed the tube after repeat laryngoscopy. A mucus plug was seen at the tip of the tube. The ventilation became better. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed and trachea was extubated. The child had good respiratory efforts with bilateral equal air entry. The child was shifted to the pediatric intensive care unit for further management. The child was nursed in the incubator and ECG and pulse oximeter monitoring were continued. The vitals and urinary output were within normal limits. The humidified oxygen was supplemented using an oxygen hood. The postoperative hemoglobin was 9.9 g/dL. The serum electrolytes were normal. The analgesia was provided with rectal paracetamol suppository.

            "input": "A 46 year old male, a known hypertensive on treatment for the past 10 years, was diagnosed to have chronic renal failure 3 years ago. Consequently he progressed to ESRD and hemodialysis was initiated in December 2006 for the same, with the creation of a brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula over the left arm. He has been undergoing regular thrice weekly hemodialysis since then. He is a school teacher by occupation. He had no past history of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, or hepatic disease. No past history of Tuberculosis or TB contact. He is married and has two sons. He was a non-smoker and a non-alcoholic.\nOver the past year, the artificial AV fistula enlarged in size to attain its current dimensions (Figure ). On 3rd June 2008, he presented to the emergency department of our tertiary care hospital with complaints of progressive breathlessness over the past 15 days. There was no history of associated chest pain, palpitations, syncope, cough, expectoration, or orthopnea.\nOn examination, he had pallor and bilateral pitting pedal edema. He was afebrile, with a pulse rate of 108/min, BP of 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28/min. A giant arteriovenous fistula was seen extending from the cubital fossa of the left arm up to the left supraclavicular region (Figure ). Respiratory system examination revealed stony dullness over the left mammary, infra-axillary and sub-scapular areas on percussion. On auscultation, there was decreased intensity of breath sounds over the above mentioned areas. Normal vesicular breath sounds were heard over all other areas. Other systems examination was unremarkable.\nHis blood investigations showed hemoglobin of 4.5 g/dl, BUN – 13 mg/dl, creatinine- 2.6 mg/dl, with other parameters being within normal limits. His coagulation profile was slightly deranged with a raised INR (Table ). Chest X-ray revealed a massive pleural effusion on the left side (Figure ). USG guided pleural aspiration revealed a hemorrhagic fluid. Pleural fluid analysis showed no WBCs, RBC – 5000/mm3 (normocytic 22%, crenated 88%), sugar – 70 mgs/dl, protein – 4.3 g/dl. Doppler study of the AV fistula showed a high peak velocity of 350 cms/sec, with no evidence of thrombosis or stenosis. In order to drain the hemorrhagic pleural effusion, an intercostal drain was placed. Patient was managed with 5 units packed red cell transfusion, oxygen and other supportive measures. With this presentation the possible cause for the left hemothorax was suspected to be due to the AV fistula. Hence after the patient was stabilized, the giant AV fistula was ligated on the 6th day after admission. Following ligation of the fistula, the patient's left sided pleural effusion decreased. The chest drain was removed after 7 days and patient was discharged after 3 more days. On follow up 6 weeks later, the patient did not have a recurrence of pleural effusion (Figure ). For further hemodialysis, the creation of a new fistula on his right arm has been planned.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?\n\nMean Arterial Pressure (MAP): MAP = 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure)",

            "input": "A 10-year-old girl was admitted to our clinic due to ketoacidosis associated with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. Prior to admission, she had suffered from polyuria, polydipsia, and nycturia for about 2 weeks, and presented with fatigue, drowsiness and a lack of appetite for the last two days. Her history did not include any chronic diseases, and she had normal growth and development.\nOn admission, she was in a serious state, suffering from vomiting and dehydration, and displaying Kussmaul breathing, a respiratory rate of 45 breaths/min and tachycardia. The blood test revealed a blood glucose level of 26.8 mmol/L (482 mg/dl), pH 6.902, base excess (BE) of − 29.3 mmol/L, HbA1c of 12.9%, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.11 mEq/L and ketone level of 6.1 mmol/L. The patient was treated according to the recommendations of the International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes and the Polish Diabetes Association [, ].\nInitially the patient received 500 ml of 0.9% NaCl IV infusion. Next, a continuous IV infusion of short acting insulin was commenced with 2,5 U/ h dose, taking into consideration that the patient weight was 40 kg. IV Insulin infusion was sustained for 51 h with dosages ranging from 1,5 U/h to 4 U/h. Overall the patient received 81,75 units of IV insulin during the first 24 h of treatment. Moreover, potassium was supplemented intravenously accordingly to changes in electrolytes results. Although she remained in a serious condition during the first 24 h of treatment, she stopped vomiting and showed gradual improvement in blood test results, with pH normalization and a decrease in the level of ketones. The glucose level was maintained between 8.3 and 13.9 mmol/L (150–250 mg/dl) with intravenous insulin and glucose infusions. The neurological status was checked hourly, and was reported as stable. An ECG was performed within the first few hours of admission, which did not reveal any crucial abnormalities aside from tachycardia. The patient received 65 units of IV insulin during the second 24 h f treatment. During the whole continuous insulin infusion the patient fluid input was 7850 ml (4750 ml IV, 3100 ml orally) and diuresis was 3400 ml.\nThe patient’s overall condition improved during the second day of treatment, despite the fact that she was still receiving intravenous insulin. That day irregular heartbeats were noticed on auscultation during the physical examination and on the ECG monitor. A second ECG showed premature ventricular complexes (PVCs; also known as trigeminy) with LBBB (left bundle branch block) morphology and a normal axis (Fig. ). Continuous ECG monitoring was subsequently implemented, and the patient underwent a cardiac consultation. The echocardiogram showed no abnormalities in the structures of the heart and great vessels. The consultant cardiologist confirmed the diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmia (PVCs). The blood results revealed hypokalemia (nadir at 2.9 mmol/L) and hypophosphatemia (nadir at 0.45 mmol/L).\nThe ECG performed after the first recognition of the patient’s the irregular heart rhythm (Fig. ) showed: sinus rhythm at 100/min, normal cardiac axis, with premature ventricular complexes. Normal PQ interval (0,14 s), normal QRS duration (0,08 s), normal QT interval (0,31 s)and QTc 0,40 QTd 0,04 s. Normal T wave and repolarization. The biochemistry results at that moment were: Na 134 mmol/L Na 134 mmol/l [132–145]; K 3,56 mmol/l [4,1-5,3]; Ca 2,70 mmol/l [2,1-2,6]; Mg 0,83 mmol/l [0,53-1,11]; Phosphate 0,45 mmol/l [1,1-2,0] (assessed for the first time); pH 7,34 [7,35-7,45]; BE-11,5 mmol/l [− 2,0/+ 3,0]; HCO3 14,2 mmol/l [22,5-30,0]. CK level was not determined. The pattern visible in the ECG was not typical of hypokalemia, which is connected with initial T-wave decrease, followed by ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, PR interval prolongation and increased P-wave amplitude, observed with further decreases in serum potassium levels. Severe hypokalemia may be associated with giant U-waves created by T- and U-wave fusion. Tachyarrhythmia and rarely atrioventricular block may evolve [–]. In our case we did not observe such abnormalities typical to low potassium level in the ECG. Moreover, the ECG was not typical of hypercalcaemia, which causes prolonged PQ interval and shortening of QT interval [, ]. Taking above into consideration we propose possible association between hypophosphatemia and premature ventricular complexes reported in the ECG.\nPotassium was supplemented both orally and intravenously. Overall the patient received 123 mEq of potassium during the continuous insulin therapy. As far as phosphorus is concerned, the patient was fed with liquid dairy products that were rich in phosphate, as she was only able to swallow small amounts of non-solid foods due to odynophagia. She was also started on oral phosphate supplementation (phosphate mixture containing 17.8 g Na2HPO4 and 4.88 g NaH2PO4 in 100 ml of distilled water, containing 1.6 mmol of inorganic phosphate per 1 ml). As 1 mmol of inorganic phosphate weighs 31 mg, our patient was receiving 62 mg Pi/kg body weight every 24 h from the phosphate mixture. She continued to present an irregular heart rate, thus a 24-h ECG Holter monitor examination was performed. The results showed 38,000 monomorphic PVCs, 1615 occurrences of ventricular bigeminy, 1230 of ventricular trigeminy and 453 of ventricular quadrigeminy, which comprised 38% of all the heart electrical activity recorded.\nThe patient was started on intensive subcutaneous insulin regimen at the 3 day of treatment, after the biochemistry results improved. In the beginning she was receiving 15 units of ultra- long acting basal insulin and 27,5 units of rapid acting insulin for meals and correction doses.\nThe patient’s serum phosphate level normalized over the few next days of treatment (Table ), and ventricular arrhythmia ceased almost completely. Subsequent ECG Holter examination showed 1760 PVCs, 13 episodes of ventricular bigeminy and 79 episodes of ventricular trigeminy. Additionally, we noticed hypocalcaemia after 3 days of phosphate supplementation. Taking into consideration the patient’s severe vitamin D3 deficiency (25(OH)D3 level 9.83 ng/ml), we supplemented both calcium and vitamin D3.\nGradually the patient regained insulin sensivity and entered a partial remission phase. C- peptide level was 0,84 ng/ml.\nThe patient was discharged in an overall good condition receiving intensive functional insulin therapy. The regimen included 10 units of basal insulin administered once daily in the evening and rapid acting insulin with insulin: carbohydrate ratio set for each meal and also with recommended correction doses.\nA cardiac check-up at the outpatient clinic following discharge revealed no signs of cardiac arrhythmia. The patient is currently on an insulin pump therapy regimen, and her growth and development are within the normal range.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L.\n\nFree Water Deficit: free_water_deficit = (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1)",

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an ill-defined mass lesion that was 2.6 × 2.4 × 1.8 cm in size in the left lateral part of the oral cavity (Figures and , stage III, T2N1). He was previously healthy and had no history of systemic disease or medication. Preoperative evaluations, including laboratory tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography, were unremarkable.\nPatient monitors were instituted, including standard monitors and continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring with radial artery catheter insertion. General anaesthesia was induced with intravenous injections of fentanyl (100 μg), lidocaine (60 mg), propofol (120 mg), and rocuronium (50 mg) and maintained with 7–10 vol% desflurane. After the induction of anaesthesia, nasal packing was performed with cotton swabs moistened with a 0.01% epinephrine solution. Nasotracheal intubation was performed using fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FI-10RBS, Pentax, Japan), and a 6.5 mm reinforced tube was inserted. After intubation, a central venous catheter (CVC, Bio Line, 7 F double lumen catheter, Ewha Biomedics, Republic of Korea) was inserted into the right subclavian vein using the anatomical landmark technique.\nPartial mandibulectomy (from # 21 to the mandibular angle), radical neck dissection, and reconstruction with a fibular free flap were performed (). The operation time was approximately 13 hours and 25 minutes. The infused volume was crystalloid 7200 ml, colloid 1700 ml, packed red blood cells (pRBC) 5 units, and fresh frozen plasma 5 units. The urine output was 3800 ml, and the estimated blood loss was approximately 1800 ml. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was kept sedated with endotracheal intubation.\nThe patient recovered from anaesthesia 3 hours after the surgery. Ventilator weaning was initiated at 8 AM on the first postoperative day (POD 1), the ventilator was stopped at 1 PM, and oxygen (5 L/min) was administered via a T-piece. The patient did not complain of respiratory difficulties. The patient was evaluated before extubation, and his mental status was alert, muscle tone was intact, surgical wound condition was visually acceptable, and the endotracheal tube cuff leak test was fair. No bleeding was noted from the surgical wound. Blood pressure was maintained between 110/60 mmHg and 140/90 mmHg. Postoperative pain was treated with an intravenous infusion of patient-controlled analgesia with fentanyl and nefopam. There was no dyspnoea, and arterial oxygen saturation was 100%.\nAt 8 AM POD 2, the patient was extubated (approximately 36 hours postsurgery), and oxygen (3 L/min) was administered via a nasal prong. Four hours after extubation, his haemoglobin level decreased to 8.9 ml/dl. One unit of pRBC was transfused.\nSeven hours after extubation (POD 2, 3 PM), the patient complained of dyspnoea, and arterial oxygen saturation decreased from 100% to 87%. Bag-mask ventilation was initiated but was ineffective. Oral and nasal airway insertion was not sufficient to open the airway. Conventional direct laryngoscopy, video laryngoscopy, and laryngeal mask insertion were not successful because the structures in the oral cavity were severely distorted due to operation site oedema and haematoma. An otolaryngologist performed an emergency TT while performing bag-mask ventilation. During TT, the heart rate decreased from 90 bpm to 42 bpm. Intravenous atropine (0.5 mg) and epinephrine (200 μg) were administered. Ten minutes after the initiation of bag-mask ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated to treat cardiac arrest, and epinephrine (1 mg) was administered every 5 minutes. The TT tube was secured 28 minutes after the initiation of bag-mask ventilation. Blood pressure was 80/30 mmHg, and dopamine, dobutamine, and norepinephrine infusion (20 μg/kg/min each) were administered. The patient was connected to a ventilator and was sedated with midazolam. On POD 3, midazolam sedation was stopped; however, patient's mental status was semicomatose, and he showed seizure-like movements. A neurology consult was obtained, and postoperative computed tomography showed severe swelling and increased soft tissue density with airway compression in the left side of the face and neck (). On POD 4, a brain MRI showed a diffusely restricted lesion involving the whole cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. The patient received conservative treatment but his mental status did not recover. On POD 67, a recurring tumour was found. Further chemotherapy or radiotherapy was considered; however, it was decided that it would not be beneficial. On POD 103, the patient was transferred to a hospice.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?\n\nIdeal Body Weight: IBW = base_weight + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60), where base_weight is 50 kg for men and 45.5 kg for women",

He complained of 7/10 epigastric pain associated with nonbloody emesis. He denied melena. He was tachycardic with a heart rate of 108 as well as hypotensive with a blood pressure of 64/34. His oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. He was alert with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 14 but noted to be in severe distress, diaphoretic, and tremulous. His skin was cold and clammy and abdomen was noted to be distended and diffusely tender to palpation. A rectal exam was negative for gross blood. A FAST exam noted moderate ascites. A chest X-ray was performed and was negative for acute pathology.\nRelevant laboratory data on admission included the following: white blood cell count of 7600 per mm3, bands of 38%, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dl, platelet count of 149,000 per mm3, international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 213 U/liter, and alanine aminotransferase of 309 U/liter. Initial venous blood gas revealed a pH of 7.23, a venous bicarbonate level of 18 mmol/liter and a lactate of 6.62 mmol/liter.\nDespite four liters of intravenous crystalloid fluid resuscitation the patient remained hypotensive at 75/58. Vasopressor support was initiated with intravenous norepinephrine titrated to a dose of 30 mcg/min and vasopressin at 0.04 units/min with minimal improvement in blood pressure to 94/76. Broad spectrum antibiotics consisting of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were administered due to concerns for septic shock. SBP was considered the cause of sepsis due to patient's abdominal pain, ascites, and bandemia.\nThe patient became increasingly more confused and agitated and the trachea was electively intubated for airway control. During this time, his abdomen was noted to be more distended. Patient was deemed too unstable for abdominal CT imaging as he was requiring multiple vasopressors. Postintubation he was transferred to the medical ICU for presumed septic shock.\nOn arrival to the ICU after initial stabilization of the patient a diagnostic paracentesis was performed in order to obtain culture for possible SBP. An appropriate pocket of fluid was visualized in the right lower abdominal quadrant. Approximately five ml of bloody ascites was aspirated. Concurrently, repeat lab results reported a hemoglobin level of 4.4 g/dl and an arterial blood gas with a lactate of 12.92 mmol/liter. General surgery was immediately consulted due to concerns for intraabdominal hemorrhage. At the same time the patient's girlfriend arrived to the hospital and stated that the patient had complained of falling in the bathroom earlier that day. General surgery recommended angiogram to locate the source of suspected intraabdominal bleeding. Interventional radiology was contacted for emergent angiogram to evaluate for a hepatic or splenic hemorrhage. Massive transfusion protocol was initiated and intravenous epinephrine was added to norepinephrine and vasopressin due to persistent hypotension. He was transferred to the IR suite.\nThe right common femoral artery was accessed and an angiogram was performed initially finding vague contrast blush in the right hepatic lobe which was empirically embolized with Gelfoam and detachable coils. There was extensive contrast extravasation from the distal splenic artery (). The splenic artery was embolized and angiogram postembolization demonstrated no further contrast extravasation (). Patient's blood pressure increased from 70 systolic to 100 immediately after embolization. On examination post angiogram, his abdomen was tense. Patient was also oliguric therefore, the decision was made to take him immediately for exploratory laparotomy for treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a cirrhotic liver without signs of injury and a two-centimeter grade 1 splenic laceration at the lower pole which was not actively bleeding. A total of nine liters of bloody ascites were evacuated from the abdomen. The abdomen was left open and a Bogota bag was sutured to the fascia. He was transfused a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and a unit of platelets during the procedure.\nHe was brought back to the operating room (OR) two days later and was found to have active bleeding at the anterior surface of the hilum of the spleen. This was cauterized, stopping the bleeding. On hospital day four he was taken back to the OR and the abdomen was closed. He was extubated on hospital day seven. Hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury which resolved, as well as seizures attributed to alcohol withdrawal treated with chlordiazepoxide. Patient was discharged home and at a clinic follow-up two months post hospitalization he was noted to be doing well and abstaining from alcohol.\n\nWhat is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?\n\nFibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT)",

Her vital signs were within normal\nlimits, her blood pressure was not elevated, and she was well-appearing. Her\nscreening lipid panel was within normal limits (cholesterol 125 mg/dL, high-density\nlipoprotein 49 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein 63 mg/dL, and triglycerides 68 mg/dL).\nPoint-of-care screening HgbA1C was significant for a value of 8.5% with a repeat\nvalue of 8.7%. The endocrinology team was consulted by phone and the patient denied\nsymptoms of weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria, nocturia, and polyphagia; however, a\nstrong family history of diabetes was reported ().\nIn the setting of a new diagnosis of diabetes, she was referred to the Cincinnati\nChildren’s Hospital Medical Center Emergency Department for further evaluation and\nmanagement. On evaluation in the emergency department additional laboratory studies\nwere sent to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes and evaluate its etiology. Laboratory\nstudies included a repeat serum HgbA1C, electrolytes, urinalysis, and an islet cell\nautoantibody screen. Additionally, routine new-onset diabetes screening laboratory\ntests, which included a thyroid stimulating hormone, immunoglobulin A (IgA), and\ntissue transglutaminase IgA, were also sent. On laboratory evaluation, she had no\nevidence of acidosis or urine ketones and a random serum glucose was within normal\nlimits (111 mg/dL) but with glycosuria.

The patient's symptoms aggravated at fetal gestational age of 10 weeks and her last pregnancy was aborted 2 years earlier at another hospital due to severe intestinal obstruction. She had suffered from unexplainable obstructive symptoms 5 years earlier and was diagnosed with CIP because of repetitive obstructive symptoms without any visible obstructive lesion observed on abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT), barium enema, or colonoscopy (). Anorectal manometry was performed at another hospital and the results were normal. She was most recently admitted to our hospital 5 months ago because of recurrent obstructive symptoms. Because the intravenous administration of neostigmine was not effective, colonoscopic decompression was performed at that time. The patient was discharged after her condition improved.\nAt the time of admission, physical examination revealed the presence of abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell count of 8,120/mm3, a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, a platelet count of 281,000/mm3, a blood sugar level of 99 mg/dL, a blood urea nitrogen level of 12.2 mg/dL, a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, a sodium level of 139 mEq/L, a potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, a chloride level of 104 mEq/L, a calcium level of 8.7 mg/dL, a phosphorous level of 3.6 mg/dL, and a magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL. Neither radiologic study nor neostigmine administration could be performed because of the risk to the fetus. Colonoscopy was performed to provide decompression because the patient's pain and distension worsened after 5 days of conservative care. The colonoscope was passed just beyond the splenic flexure, at which point the lumen was found to be obstructed by a large fecal bezoar (). Attempts to break the fecal bezoar with an endoscopic snare (Olympus Disposable Electrosurgical Snare SD-210U-10; Olympus Medical Systems Corp., Tokyo, Japan) met with limited success. After suctioning the retained gas and contents of the proximal colon, a drainage catheter (ENBD-7-LIGUORY, 7 Fr, 250 cm; Cook Medical Inc., Winston-Salem, NC, USA) was placed through the working channel of the endoscope. The catheter was irrigated periodically with normal saline to prevent obstruction and ensure that the intestinal contents and gas were drained effectively. The patient's symptoms improved for a few days after decompression but recurred soon thereafter. Additional two attempts at endoscopic decompression were made and a new drainage catheter was inserted in each of the attempts until surgery could be performed.\nSubtotal colectomy with endileostomy was performed electively at a fetal gestational age of 21 weeks. Ileorectal anastomosis could not be performed due to the enlarged uterus and was postponed until after delivery. The excised colon measured 100 cm in length. The proximal portion from the cecum to the descending colon was dilated up to 16 cm in diameter and a focally narrowed transitional zone was observed around the sigmoid colon (). Full colonic sections were obtained for histopathological analysis, which revealed no apparent histopathological alteration in the muscularis propria or neural plexuses (). However, immunohistochemistry for C-KIT (CD 117) revealed fewer interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) in dilated portions of the colon compared to the undilated part (). Stool passage was normalized after surgery and pregnancy was maintained and resulted in a full-term delivery.\n\nWhat is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?\n\nSodium Correction for Hyperglycemia: correction = Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100)",

            "input": "A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().\nDuring the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.\nThe patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).\nAlthough chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.\nLight microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.\nThe patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.\n\nUsing the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nMDRD GFR Equation: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient, where race_coefficient is 1.212 for black patients and 1.0 for non-black parients, and gender_coefficient is 1 for men and 0.742 for women",

At the time of presentation, central nervous system examination revealed a conscious, oriented patient with normal higher function, without diplopia or neck rigidity. There was no loss of power in all four limbs, 4/5 in both the upper limbs, and 4/5 in both the lower limbs as per Medical Research Council (MRC) rating. His sensory system, other cranial nerves, brain-stem function appeared normal. His other systems were within the normal limit. His vitals were also within the normal limit (pulse rate: 70/ min, regular; blood pressure: 124/76 mm Hg, respiratory rate: 14/ min). Laboratory investigations (routine hematological; liver and kidney function tests; serum electrolytes; coagulation profile), chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG) were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain showed gross subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) but no focal lesion of parenchyma or any midline shift []. Cerebral angiography revealed an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, which was thought to be the cause of SAH and IVH. According to Hunt and Hess classification, he was considered grade II. The patient was posted for clipping of anterior communicating artery aneurysm through the pterion (right) approach. An informed consent was taken for surgery, anesthesia, and postoperative care in ICU.\nThe patient was premedicated with tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg orally at the night before operation. On the day of surgery, after establishing intravenous (IV) line with 18G cannula, the patient received injection (Inj) midazolam 2 mg, Inj ondansetron 6 mg, and Inj glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg. General anesthesia was induced by Inj fentanyl (2 μg/ kg) and thiopentone (5 mg/kg) following preoxygenetion and intubation was done with size 8.5 flexometallic endotracheal tube (Sheridan/SPIRAL-FLEX®, Hudson RCI) using Inj rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained with O2:N2O (40:60), propofol (infusion at 100-150 μg/kg/min) and intermittent bolus of Inj vecuronium and Inj fentanyl. Mannitol (1 g/kg) was infused to provide optimum brain relaxation. For invasive monitoring, central venous catheter was placed via the right subclavian vein and intra-arterial catheter was placed at left radial artery. Intraoperative monitoring included five lead ECG, invasive blood pressure, SpO2, end tidal carbon dioxide, central venous pressure, urine output, core temperature, bi-spectral index, and neuromuscular monitoring. Keyhole-type craniotomy was done and surgery proceeded uneventfully in the supine position and haemodynamics remained stable throughout the operative period, which lasted for 6 h. N2O was discontinued before dural closure. At the end of the surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed when the TOF ratio was 40% with 0.5 mg Inj glycopyrrolate and 2.5 mg neostigmine. The trachea was extubated once the TOF ratio was 90%, respiratory effort was adequate, and patient was obeying commands. He was shifted to the postoperative recovery room.\nOne hour after surgery, the patient developed sudden generalized convulsions, a rapid deterioration in the consciousness level, with dilatation of the left pupil. The airway was secured with Gudel's airway (number 5) and Inj midazolam 4 mg was given to control the convulsions. He maintained an oxygen saturation of 97-99% with 3L oxygen through the facemask. His arterial blood pressure and pulse rate were 120/70 mmHg and 92/ min, respectively. An immediate computed tomography (CT) scan of brain done postoperatively, revealed accumulation of air in the bi-frontal subdural space compressing mainly the right sylvian fissure and right lateral ventricle without any apparent midline shift (mount Fuji sign []), indicating a diagnosis of tension pneumocephalus. The patient was taken to the operation theatre immediately for aspiration of pneumocephalus through a frontal drill hole and air came out under pressure. The patient's sensorium showed marked improvement after the surgery and he started responding to verbal commands. The rest of the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 15 days later without any neurological deficit.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.\nAcidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.\nOur patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI.

Patient was started on treatment with normal saline at initial rate of 15-25 ml/kg/h and regular insulin at 0.1 U/kg/hour. Later on, intravenous antibiotics were added in view of consolidation. His urine routine examination, urine culture sensitivity, blood culture sensitivity were normal. Vasopressors were added (nor adrenaline, adrenaline and vasopressin) because of persistent shock, he was put on mechanical ventilation due to persistent altered sensorium and respiratory failure. Due to severe metabolic acidosis, he was given intravenous bicarbonate of 260 Meq in the initial 24 hours. However, his metabolic acidosis and shock persisted, so, he was started on peritoneal dialysis. After 12 hours of peritoneal dialysis, his arterial blood pH improved to 7.118 with bicarbonate of 15.1 meq/dl. So his peritoneal dialysis was continued and his arterial blood pH improved to 7.311 with bicarbonate of 14.0 meq/dL after 36 hours. His peritoneal dialysis was given for total of 80 cycles. Vasopressors were tapered off and he was subsequently extubated on day 5 of admission. Patient required 4 more cycles of haemodialysis for persistent oliguria with rising serum creatinine levels – which was probably due to persistent shock related acute cortical necrosis. He was discharged on day 16 of illness.\n\nWhat is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?\n\nSodium Correction for Hyperglycemia: correction = Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100)",

            "input": "A 47-year-old female (height, 160 cm; weight, 60 kg) with a giant liver due to polycystic liver disease (PLD) was scheduled to undergo ABO-incompatible living donor liver transplantation because of worsening malnutrition, disability in activities of daily living, and abdominal distention, which were converted to 16 points by the model for end-stage liver disease score. In the past 3 years, coil embolization of the hepatic artery and percutaneous drainage of liver cysts had been performed. After the liver cyst drainage, biliary peritonitis occurred and she was treated with antibiotics.\nPreoperative computed tomography revealed remarkable abdominal distension caused by an enlarged polycystic liver (). Results of laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb), 10.1 g/dL; platelet (Plt) count, 27.4 × 104/μL; albumin, 2.2 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 31.3 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.90 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 0.31 mg/dL; alanine transaminase, 13 U/L; aspartate transaminase, 15 U/L; prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR), 1.18; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 30.0 sec; fibrinogen, 573 mg/dL. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, and transthoracic echocardiography showed normal cardiac function. Portal hypertension was not predicted. The surgeons pointed out a risk of bleeding because of surgical difficulties due to PLD and strong adhesion induced by peritonitis. Blood loss anticipated by the surgeon was 15000 ml. The transfusion unit was preoperatively informed about the possibility of massive transfusion. We ordered 5,600 mL of O type red blood cells (RBC), 4,800 mL of AB type fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 800 mL of AB type platelet concentrate (PC).\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, three 18-gauge peripheral catheters, a 12-gauge triple-lumen central venous catheter, and a pulmonary arterial catheter were placed. Since total clamping of the inferior vena cava requiring veno-veno bypass might be necessary, two 4-Fr introducer sheaths were placed at the femoral vein and the intrajugular vein. Soon after the start of surgery, massive bleeding of more than 4,000 mL/hr occurred (). We started massive transfusion of FFP at a ratio of about 1 : 1 with RBC. We also transfused 5% albumin and restricted the crystalloid solution. Reinfusion of salvaged blood and use of veno-veno bypass with retrieved blood from the operative field were avoided because many cysts of the PLD ruptured during surgery and the blood in the operative field was contaminated by the cystic content. We constantly ordered blood products and communicated with the transfusion unit.\nThe bleeding rate increased as the surgery progressed because bleeding occurred from the area where the tissue was detached from adhesion. Body temperature rapidly decreased despite the use of a rapid infusion and fluid warming system (Level 1 Fast Flow Fluid Warmer, Smiths Medical ASD Inc., Rockland, MA, USA) through 4-Fr introducer sheaths. Although catecholamine administration and massive transfusion from 5 venous lines including the introducer sheath were performed by many anesthesiologists, it was extremely difficult to maintain blood pressure and a critical situation with a risk of cardiac arrest continued due to hypotension. In addition, even though administration of insulin and calcium was performed, electrolyte disturbances of K+ of 6.3 mEq/L and Ca2+ of 2.1 mg/dL (normal range: 4.6–5.3 mg/dL) with peaked T wave and prolongation of QTc interval (557 msec) occurred (Figures and ). At that time, we visually noticed that the QT interval was shortened in response to bolus calcium administration, and we therefore displayed the QTc interval on a bedside monitor (CSM-1000 series Life Scope G, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and used the change of real-time QTc interval as a supportive indicator for calcium correction (maximum rate: 120 mEq/hr) combined with blood gas analysis. The hepatectomy was performed without veno-veno bypass 4.5 hours after the start of surgery and the bleeding rate at that time was 15,000 mL/hr (). The excised polycystic liver weighed 10.0 kg.\nUntil portal reperfusion, we continued massive transfusion (approximately 12,000 mL/hr) including 300 mL of PC and sodium bicarbonate with additional fluid warming systems. After portal reperfusion, the bleeding rate gradually decreased and the hemodynamic variables and electrolyte disturbance improved (Figures and ; ). After anastomosis of the hepatic artery, 1 g of tranexamic acid was administered. Except for PC, which was transported from transfusion centers in our region and/or neighboring regions, the supply of blood products was not interrupted and coagulation factors were maintained throughout the surgery by administration of FFP and 3 g of fibrinogen with at least 1.26 of PT-INR, 43.6 sec of APTT, and 116 mg/dL of fibrinogen (). The abdomen was packed with gauzes and closed because complete hemostasis was difficult. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Soon after arrival at the ICU, she responded to command. On postoperative day (POD) 2, second-look surgery was performed for removal of packed gauzes. She was extubated on POD 3 without pulmonary edema or cardiac overload.\nThe duration of surgery was 16 hours and 53 minutes and the duration of general anesthesia was 22 hours and 27 minutes. Throughout the surgery, anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% sevoflurane, 0.16–0.33 μg−1 ・kg−1 ・min−1 of remifentanil, and intermittent fentanyl administration (total of 1.5 mg). Bispectral IndexTM (Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, USA) values were between 30 and 60. Cardiac index was between 1.2 and 2.8 L−1 ・min−1 ・m−2. A total of 742 mEq of calcium ion, 750 mL of 7% sodium bicarbonate, and 18 units of insulin were administered. Postoperative analysis of the relationship between QTc interval and Ca2+ during surgery showed a strong negative correlation (). Representative laboratory data are shown in . Total infusion volume was 88,560 mL (crystalloid solution: 3,450 mL; 6% hydroxyethyl starch: 3,500 mL; 5% albumin: 10,490 mL; RBC: 34,160 mL; FFP: 34,600 mL; PC: 2,400 mL), and total output volume was 86,350 mL (estimated volume of blood loss including ascites and cystic fluid: 81,600 mL; urine output: 4,750 mL); therefore, intraoperative fluid balance was +2,210 mL. Although she suffered from acute rejection and sepsis, she finally regained independent living by rehabilitation and was discharged on POD 156.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

On examination, he was alert, and his blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature were 74/44 mmHg, 130 beats/min, 16 breaths/min, 92% (under ambient air), and 37.5 °C, respectively. Arterial blood gas findings were as follows: pH of 7.44; PaO2 of 75; PaCO2 of 37; HCO3 of 25.1, and lactate of 32 mg/dL. His lactate level was elevated, and he developed septic shock. The WBC count was 13,000/μL, the Hb level was 13.5 g/dL, and the PLT count was 142,000/μL.

            "input": "An 80-year-old male with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and diabetes presented with 2 days of gross hematuria, worsening hesitancy, and difficulty urinating. Prior to this, the patient had had a 6-month history of lower urinary tract symptoms for which his primary medical doctor had prescribed an α1 receptor antagonist at a dose of 0.4 mg orally once daily. This initially brought about brief mild improvement in the patient’s symptoms, but ultimately there was an increase in lower urinary tract symptoms. The patient denied renal colic, flank pain, or any constitutional symptoms. He had not suffered any recurrent urinary tract infections in the past and denied taking any anticoagulants other than two aspirin occasionally for headache.\nOn presentation to the urology clinic, the patient was found to have severe obstructive urinary symptoms. Rectal examination revealed a grossly abnormal prostate gland with nodularity throughout the entire palpable surface. Laboratory information showed a prostate serum antigen of 20.2 ng/mL. His most recently documented prostate serum antigen was 8.5 ng/mL, which was from one year previously. Baseline blood urea nitrogen/creatinine was 32/0.87. Because the patient had obstructive symptoms and a post void residual of 319 mL, a Foley catheter was placed and he was scheduled for a cystoscopy (as part of the hematuria workup)/voiding trial. He was also put on silodosin 8 mg per day orally and ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. Upon the patient’s return to the office, his Foley catheter was draining adequately. Post void residual was 600 mL. Cystoscopy showed a large amount of clot in the base of the bladder, which was irrigated to clear, and no active bleeding was noted. Significant distortion and posterior impingement of the trigone was noted, left hemitrigone being greater than the right. No diverticulum or stones were noted. Prostatic urethra showed a near visually obstructing prostate but no intraluminal filling defects of the bladder. A computed tomography (CT) urogram showed left hydronephrosis down to the trigone and some mild nonspecific adenopathy. Urine culture and sensitivity was positive for a Proteus urinary tract infection. The patient was already on ciprofloxacin (which was shown to be sensitive) and responding to treatment. Bicalutamide 50 mg orally once daily and finasteride 5 mg orally once daily were prescribed.\nThe patient underwent transrectal ultrasound and sampling of the prostate gland. It was noted that the patient’s prostatic volume was 14.6 cc. Due to the patient’s age, gross hematuria, and comorbid conditions, a limited six-core prostate biopsy was performed. Biopsy showed six of six cores positive for an adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 9 (5+4) prostate cancer (see ). CT scan and bone scan did not show any evidence of metastatic spread. The patient was diagnosed with clinical stage T2cN0M0 prostate cancer. The patient completed and passed a voiding trial. Bicalutamide, silodosin, and finasteride were continued. A depot suspension of leuprolide acetate (30 mg intramuscularly every four months) was started. Calcium and vitamin D were added for additional support (entirely prophylactic, given that the patient had no vitamin deficits prior to starting leuprolide). At this stage in the patient’s clinical course, his urinalysis was normal and his post void residual was down to 67 mL. The patient was counseled on the management options and chose intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as treatment for his prostate cancer.\nFiduciary gold seed markers were placed. The patient underwent a planning CT scan which was fused with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The prostate and seminal vesicles were contoured with a planning CT scan, expanded into planning target volumes, and a radiation plan was developed. The patient received 46 treatments over 64 days for a total dose of 8,280 cGy. Phase 1 (planning target volume 1) consisted of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and regional lymph nodes receiving 4,500 cGy in 180 cGy daily fractions. Phase 2 (planning target volume 2) consisted of the prostate alone receiving 3,780 cGy in 180 cGy daily doses. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy using an image-guided linear accelerator (Varian Instruments Inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was utilized to minimize both acute side effects and long-term sequelae. The patient tolerated his treatments well. Mild urinary symptoms were experienced, but his urination had been improving and his international prostate symptom score was <15 (9). Therefore, the patient did not require any additional medications and we felt that any surgical intervention (such as transurethral resection of the prostate) for symptomatic relief was not warranted at this time. The patient did develop some bowel symptoms that required a change in diet.\nThe patient was examined by his urologist post radiation therapy and was clinically doing well. He had a post void residual of 104 mL and a significantly reduced prostate serum antigen of 0.4 ng/mL. Repeat renal and bladder ultrasound showed resolution of his previously noted left hydronephrosis. However, just after intensity-modulated radiation therapy ended, the patient began to experience right lower extremity weakness and intermittent numbness from the mid calf distally. The patient had not experienced any falls or trauma. His serum glucose was under control throughout his entire evaluation (prior to treatment it was noted to be 122 mg/dL and then post treatment measured 88 mg/dL). This progressed to require an evaluation by a neurologist. Physical examination showed a mild wide-based stance with decreased stride length and a tendency to circumduct the right lower extremity, with mild to moderate right foot-drop. Initial evaluation included a lumbar puncture, comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, urinalysis, positron emission tomography scan, renal ultrasound, and CT scans of the head and spine. All initial studies were negative. Further evaluation included an electromyogram, as well as an MRI scan of the brain/cervical and thoracic spines. MRI of the brain specifically showed only mild diffuse cortical atrophy. The cervical and thoracic spine MRI scans showed a T2 hyperintensity spanning the lateral cortical spinal tracts of the entire cervical and thoracic cords.\nBlood work was collected locally, sent to the Mayo Clinic, and profiled in their paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation. The profile was consistent with organ-specific neurologic autoimmunity, which suggested an association with multifocal neurologic mainfestations. Specifically, the blood work revealed a positive neuronal voltage-gated potassium channel antibody. These findings combined with MRI of the spine led the neurologist to diagnose the patient with a paraneoplastic syndrome. Magnetic resonance neurography was not done. The patient’s nerve pain was based solely on his personal perspective. The patient was given an ankle-foot orthosis and a cane for ambulation, was started on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and referred for home-based physical therapy. At this time, the patient felt that both his strength and ambulation had improved, and his physical therapist agreed. The patient has not experienced any new complaints.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nCKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate: GFR = 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coefficient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

Physical examination revealed mild proteinuria, hypertension and moderate anasarca (periorbital edema, ascites, and lower-extremity pitting edema). No medication and renal biopsy were performed because of the silent findings. However, two weeks later, after the admission for HSP, he complained of polydipsia and polyuria complaints and a physical examination revealed a 10-kg decrease in his baseline weight. There was no parental history of diabetes. In physical examinaTion weight: 16 kg (3rd percentile); height: 115 cm (25–50th percentile); pulse rate: 80/min; respiratory rate: 24/min; blood pressure: 100/60 mmHg; temperature: 36°C, his general state was poor and his consciousness was lethargic. Skin turgor and tonus were also diminished. There were petechial rashes on his abdomen and lower extremities that progressed to nonblanchable macules (Figure ). He also had a fruity breath smell, dry mucous membranes, and tachypnea. Other examinations were normal. Laboratory studies yielded the following values (normal ranges were given in brackets): white blood cell count; 14.200/mm3 (6000–17500) with a normal differential formula; blood urea nitrogen, 9.34 mg/dL (5.7–20.1); serum creatinine, 0.6 mg/dL (0.1–0.9); albumin, 4.2 g/dL (3.5-5); sodium, 127 mmol/L (139–146); potassium, 4.51 mmol/ L (3.5–6.0); phosphorus, 2.8 mg/dL (4.9–7.9); and glucose, 27.83 mmol/L (3.3–5.0). Arterial blood gas values showed a pH of 7.10 (7.35–7.45); and bicarbonate: 8.4 mmol/L (21–28). Urine and serum ketones were positive. Urinalysis showed glycosuria. HbA1c was 11.7% (4.2-6.4). C-peptid level was 0.7 ng/mL (1.1-3.2). Insulin level was 4.28 μIU/mL (1.9-23). Autoantibodies including insulin, islet cell, glutamic acid decarboxylase were negative. Thyroid function tests were normal. Prothrombine time and partial thromboplastin time, immunoglobulin A, complement proteins C3 and C4, anti-DNA, antinuclear antibodies, and ASO levels were normal, as were serological tests for EBV and TORCH. Serum antigliadin and anti-endomysium antibodies were negative for the diagnosis of Celiac disease. Occult blood test in stool, urine and throat cultures were negative. The diagnosis of type 1 DM which presented with diabetic ketoacidosis accompanied by HSP was clinically made. A bolus of normal saline (20 mL/kg) was given intravenously, after which intravenous fluids were continued. Regular insulin via a continuous infusion at 0.1 IU/kg/h was started, and potassium was administered at 1 mEq/kg/day. The patient subsequently recovered and was followed by the Pediatric Diabetes Unit and given continued insulin treatment.\n\nWhat is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?\n\nSerum Osmolality: sOsm = 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18)",

She was found to be obtunded in our Emergency department and was intubated for airway protection. She was febrile (39.33°C, 102.8°F), but hemodynamically stable. She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.\nEven after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ). Her family eventually made the decision to focus on comfort measures only, following which, she had a cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 17.\n\nUsing the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nMDRD GFR Equation: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient, where race_coefficient is 1.212 for black patients and 1.0 for non-black parients, and gender_coefficient is 1 for men and 0.742 for women",

He had a 16-year history of organic psychiatric disorder induced by a large hematoma and contusion of the brain following injury in a traffic accident. Because of delusions of persecution and severe irritability, the patient was treated with several antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, including zotepine (400 mg/day for 6 years), risperidone (12 mg/day for 8 years), paliperidone (12 mg/day for 3 years), olanzapine (20 mg/day for 8 years), and lithium (1200 mg/day for 6 years). His serum lithium concentration ranged from 0.75 to 1.35 mEq/mL.\nThe patient’s clinical course is shown in Fig. . At admission, the patient’s height was 176.1 cm and his body weight was 77.1 kg. His blood pressure was 136/102 mmHg and his pulse rate was 111 beats per minute. His body temperature was 37.6 °C on admission (Day 1). Laboratory examinations on Day 2 revealed a white blood cell count of 11,480/mL (range 3500–8500), C-reactive protein of 2.89 mg/dL (range 0.00–0.30), aspartate transaminase of 130 U/L (range 13–33), alanine transaminase of 245 U/L (range 8–42), alkaline phosphatase of 692 U/L (range 115–359), lactate dehydrogenase of 230 U/L (range 119–229), total bilirubin of 6.3 mg/dL (range 0.3–1.2), γ-glutamyltransferase of 348 U/L (range 10–47), amylase of 128 U/L (range 37–125), serum creatinine of 0.92 mg/dL (range 0.6–1.1), urea nitrogen of 5 mg/dL (range 8–22), serum sodium of 156 mmol/L (range 138–146), serum potassium of 3.7 mmol/L (range 3.6–4.9), and serum chloride of 114 mmol/L (range 99–109).\nBecause the patient’s polyuria was > 4000 mL/day, he received 3200 mL/day of 5% glucose perioperatively (Days 6–12). However, his serum sodium levels remained between 150 and 160 mmol/L. Plasma and urine osmolality were 318 mOsm/L and 141 mOsm/L, respectively, while the serum arginine vasopressin level was 6.4 pg/mL (range 0.0–3.8). Desmopressin was ineffective, resulting in a diagnosis of NDI. Nine days after admission (Day 9), laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. We gradually withdrew lithium starting on Day 15 because it was the suspected cause of NDI. Lithium was completely discontinued on Day 19. Urine volume increased further to a maximum of 10,000 mL/day. Because the patient had free water excretion resulting from NDI and we wanted to avoid excessive glucose to prevent diabetes mellitus, rehydration therapy with xylitol infusion was initiated. A maximum of 10,000 mL/day of 5% xylitol was administered for 8 days (Days 13–20).\nThe patient’s serum lithium concentration was 0.89 mEq/mL on Day 15. He developed lethargy on Day 19, although laboratory examinations showed no remarkable change (serum creatinine = 1.05 mg/dL, urea nitrogen = 8 mg/dL, serum sodium = 152 mmol/L). His consciousness level declined and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 6 points (E4V1M1) with metabolic acidosis on Day 20. The patient did not show meningeal signs, involuntary movements, or generalized tonic–clonic seizures. He had decreased muscle tension/tonus and deep tendon reflexes but showed jaw jerk reflex and snout reflex; a brainstem lesion was suspected. The patient maintained spontaneous breathing.\nArterial blood gas testing without oxygen therapy on Day 20 showed the following: fraction of inspired oxygen 0.21 (room air), pH 7.28 (range 7.36–7.44), carbon dioxide partial pressure = 14.7 (range 35.0–45.0), partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood = 117.0 (range 75.0–95.0), hydrogen carbonate ion = 6.7 (range 22.0–28.0), and base excess = − 18.7 (range 23.0–27.0). Laboratory examinations revealed the following: serum creatinine = 1.58 mg/dL, urea nitrogen = 9 mg/dL, serum sodium = 155 mmol/L, serum potassium = 3.5 mmol/L, and serum chloride = 125 mmol/L. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging on Day 20 revealed brain edema but no cerebral herniation or findings of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) was temporarily performed from Days 20 to 23, which corrected the patient’s metabolic acidosis. His consciousness level improved and his GCS rose to 12 points (E4V3M5) by Day 23. At that time, the patient showed normal brain stem reactions and deep tendon reflexes. He responded to a handshake. His serum lithium concentration was 0.05 mEq/mL on Day 22. However, his urine volume remained at approximately 3000 mL/day, serum sodium remained in the 150 mmol/L range, and serum creatinine increased to 4.74 mg/dL on Day 26. Urinalysis showed no remarkable findings throughout the examination period.\nThe patient’s serum sodium was in the high 140 mmol/L range and his creatinine level was near 1.5 mg/dL on Day 50. However, polyuria and polydipsia of approximately 4000 mL/day persisted. Renal biopsy on Day 60 showed deposition of double-refractive crystals in the cortical renal tubules. Tubular atrophy, macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration, and interstitial fibrosis were observed in parts of the tubulointerstitium. Decreased expression of water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) was observed in the cortical and medullary renal tubules (Fig. ); no urinary AQP2 was detected on ELISA (Human Aquaporin 2 ELISA Kit, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The diagnosis was lithium-induced NDI and cerebrorenal oxalosis induced by excess xylitol infusion.\nLaboratory examinations on Day 80 revealed the following: serum creatinine = 1.25 mg/dL, urea nitrogen = 7 mg/dL, serum sodium = 147 mmol/L, plasma osmolality = 297 mOsm/L, and urine osmolality = 106 mOsm/L. The patient was discharged 82 days after admission; his thirst gradually decreased to 1500 to 2000 mL of water per day by 2 months after discharge. Urinary AQP2 levels increased to 1.14 ng/mg/g of creatinine and serum creatinine decreased to a low of 0.90 mg/dL. However, plasma and urine osmolality were 292 mOsm/L and 62 mOsm/L, respectively, 4 months after discontinuing lithium. The patient has had serum creatinine levels of approximately 1.2 mg/dL since that time.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

He reported having similar episodes of nausea and vomiting in the past, which lasted 2-3 days and terminated without medical intervention. Past medical history was significant for nonulcer dyspepsia for which he took nonprescription antacids.\nOn physical examination, he was afebrile with temperature of 36.8°C, pulse of 89/min, a respiratory rate of 16/min, a blood pressure of 115/73 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing ambient air. He appeared to be uncomfortable and was curled up in bed holding his abdomen. He was alert, active, and oriented to time, place, and person. He exhibited no nystagmus and had a nonfocal neurological exam. His abdomen was soft but exhibited tenderness in the epigastric and periumbilical regions with decreased bowel sounds but no rebound tenderness or guarding. He noted relief only with hot showering and, on follow-up, would often refuse to come out of the shower to meet the physicians.\nLaboratory studies showed mild leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14 × 109/L (normal: 4–11 × 109/L).

Blood urea nitrogen was 160 mg/dL (normal: 5–26 mg/dL) and creatinine was 4.78 mg/dL (normal: 0.5–1.5 mg/dL). No baseline studies were available for comparison. Amylase, lipase, and liver function tests were normal. Plain abdominal imaging did not reveal any obstruction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed mild gastritis with unrevealing histology and microbiology. Conventional urine drug screen, which does not test for synthetic cannabinoids, was negative. His urinalysis was normal except for the presence of hyaline casts. His fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) was 0.4 and urine sodium level was 10 mmol/L (normal: 10–60 mmol/L). Renal ultrasound was normal. Based on proposed diagnostic criteria for CHS, his self-reported synthetic cannabis use, and cyclic vomiting with negative organic evaluation, diagnosis of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome with prerenal acute kidney injury was made. He was given intravenous fluids for his hypovolemia. Ondansetron was given for his nausea and vomiting, which offered no relief. His leukocytosis, nausea, and renal failure completely resolved 72 hours after admission; at that time his serum creatinine was 1.1 mg/dL. He was doing well and stayed off the K2 at outpatient follow-up 2 weeks later.\n\nWhat is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?\n\nAnion Gap: anion_gap = sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L))",

He had a past medical history of vitamin B12 deficiency for which he was getting monthly parenteral therapy. A detailed history is taken and he reported that he had no fever, chills, diarrhea, cough, anorexia, weight loss, or rash. On physical examination, the heart rate was 85 beats/min and the blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and with no organomegaly. No peripheral edema was seen. No rash, petechiae, ecchymoses, oral lesions, or lymphadenopathy was found. The arms revealed no abnormalities and the legs were normal. Neurological examination was normal.\nThe levels of glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal; also the levels of total bilirubin, aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. Lipid panel showed total cholesterol (TC) 144 mg/dl, triglycerides (TG) 79 mg /dl, HDL-C 5 mg/dl, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) 123 mg/dl. Lipid panel done three years ago showed a HDL-C of 41 mg/dl. Further workup revealed serum apolipoprotein A1 (APO A1) 97 mg/dl (94-176), apolipoprotein B (APO B) 35 mg/dl (52-109), the ratio of APO B/ APO A 1 0.36 , lipoprotein A 19.0 nmol/l (<75), and direct LDL 28 mg/dl ( <130). Important laboratory investigations are given in Table .\nThe patient was treated with an incremental dose of extended-release nicotinic acid but his HDL remained low. The secondary causes of low HDL-C levels such as the use of androgens, progestins, cigarette smoking, obesity, low-fat diet, and drugs like beta-blockers were ruled out. This leads us to consider the less well-known but well-documented fact that monoclonal gammopathies have unusual specificity for apolipoprotein, and paraproteins may interfere with the measurement of HDL-C in some automated analyzers. To confirm our hypothesis we performed serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, which showed IgG 720 mg/dl (576-1782), IgA 116 mg/dl ( 59-484) and an abnormally high IgM at 3510 mg/dl (57-266). Bone marrow biopsy showed a paratrabecular and intertrabecular infiltrates of small noncleaved lymphocytes.

Patient was living in Jizan, an endemic area of malaria, which raised suspicion of malaria infection. Patient looked unwell, conscious, and alert. His vital signs were normal except the temperature which was high (38.5 degree C). Chest examination was normal and the cardiovascular system showed normal first and second heart sounds with no added sound. Fundus examination was normal. Other systemic reviews were unremarkable. Patient was admitted in the medical ward, and baseline laboratory investigations revealed the following remarkable laboratory values: white blood cells 12 × 109/L (normal range: 4.5 to 11.0 × 109/L); hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL (normal range: 13.8 to 17.2 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume 72 fL/red cell (normal range: 80–96 fL/red cell); platelet count 62 × 103/μL (normal range: 150–400 × 103/μL); reticulocyte 2.6% (normal range: 0.5% to 2.5%); aspartate transaminase 89 U/L (normal range: 10 to 40 U/L); alanine transaminase 78 U/L (normal range: 7 to 56 U/L); total bilirubin 600 μmol/L (normal range: 1.71 to 20.5 μmol/L); direct bilirubin 200 μmol/L (normal range: less than 5.1 μmol/L); and sodium 149 mmol/L (normal range: 136–145 mmol/L), whereas the following laboratory values were found to be in normal ranges: alkaline phosphatase 120 IU/L (normal range: 44 to 147 IU/L); random blood glucose 7.2 mmol/L (normal range: 4.4–8.9 mmol/L); potassium 4.9 mmol/L (normal range: 3.6–5.2 mmol/L); magnesium 0.9 mmol/L (normal range: 0.6–1.1 mmol/L); calcium 2.3 mmol/L (normal range: 2.2–2.7 mmol/L); phosphate 1.4 mmol/L (normal range: 1.12–1.45 mmol/L); creatinine 78 mmol/L (normal range: 60–110 mmol/L); and urea 3.7 mmol/L (normal range: 2.5–7.1 mmol/L).\nECG initially showed normal sinus rhythm, and chest X-ray was normal. The patient had no previous history of cardiac arrhythmias, and his baseline ECG was normal (). Peripheral blood smear revealed P. falciparum (ring form) with parasitemia index 10%. His body weight was 74 kg and height 166 cm.\nPatient was diagnosed with severe P. falciparum malaria based on clinical presentation and laboratory investigations and started on intravenous artesunate 170 mg (2.4 mg/kg) bolus slowly over 2 minutes at 0 hour, 12 hours, and 24 hours, and every 24 hours thereafter for 5 days. The powder for injection was reconstituted with 5% sodium bicarbonate and diluted in an equal volume of normal saline. He was started on paracetamol 500 mg tablet orally as needed every 6 hours. Patient was clinically improving and temperature subsided. After 4 hours of the third dose of artesunate, the patient became sick, faint, and suddenly arrested. Resuscitation was done for 32 minutes, ECG was done and showed wide complex ventricular tachycardia, and QTc (Bazett) was 516 msec (). Electrolytes were in the normal limits: sodium 136 mmol/L; potassium 4.3 mmol/L; magnesium 0.8 mmol/L; and calcium 2.1 mmol/L. Tachycardia was managed by administration of amiodarone (150 mg i.v. for 10 minutes). The patient revived and kept in ICU for further observation. There was no worsening of hemolytic anemia during and after the treatment with artesunate. The treatment plan was not changed; the next dose of artesunate was after 24 hours of the third dose (last dose given before event happened). The patient clinically improved, fever subsided, and the temperature decreased with paracetamol to 37.4°C, and he was walking and conversing normally. The treatment was completed by oral artesunate 100 mg + sulfadoxine 500 mg/pyrimethamine 25 mg tablets (3-day course).\n\nWhat is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?\n\nSerum Osmolality: sOsm = 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18)",

            "input": "A fifteen-year-old female adolescent was admitted to the child and adolescent acute psychiatric unit of our hospital for the first time after remaining isolated in her home for four months. She had initiated treatment in the outpatient clinic of her district in June 2013, attending only one visit and refusing all psychiatric treatment thereafter.\nThere was a family history of schizophrenia in second degree relative on her mother's side. The patient's medical history, according to her family, included recurrent acute bronchitis until 10 years of age. No history of alcohol or tobacco consumption or psychoactive substance use was reported. The patient was very selective and restrictive in her meals since her childhood. She only ate biscuits, ham croquettes, bread, and omelettes.\nRegarding school, she described acceptable performance until the previous academic year when she presented some difficulties, and her teachers decided to change her to another classroom with a lower academic level.\nHer premorbid personality was described as quiet and shy, with some difficulty in social relationships, but with a group of friends at the beginning of the episode. She lived with her parents and an 18-year-old sister in a mid-size city (with a population of about 216,000 inhabitants).\nThe patient reported that during the previous academic year she had been separated from her friends due to the change of classroom and at the same time she had begun to suffer digestive cramps and headaches, and as a result she stopped going to school. She stayed at home, with no interest in leaving the house, playing computer games and surfing the internet all day from April 2013 until her admission in our department 6 months later. The family explained that she had also become withdrawn from them, showing little interest in conversation, giving only monosyllabic answers, and gesturing in response to her parents' questions. She showed neglect in her personal hygiene and apathy regarding her physical appearance.\nAt the time of her admission, the mental status examination showed she was conscious and oriented in time, place, and person, though unkempt and exhibiting psychomotor retardation, poor eye contact, and limited language, answering questions with monosyllables or gestures. She also displayed emotional lability when discussing sensitive issues like friends and school and showed hypothymia, poorly reactive mood, apathy, weakness, and anhedonia and was only interested in computer usage. She did not exhibit impaired sensory perception, self-referentiality, or psychotic behavior, though she was sleeping from 4:00 am to noon. Her food intake was very selective, limited to certain specific foods, but there was no loss of appetite. The patient denied having suicidal ideation.\nIn the first interview, apathy and depressive moods were observed when she spoke about life events related to her friends at school and how this situation interfered with her functioning. Physical examination revealed a weight of 83.1 kg, height of 1.63 m, body mass index of 31.3, body mass index standard deviation score of 2.689, and blood pleasure of 120/80 mmHg. She denied muscular pain and no goiter or myxedema.\nSoon after admission, a blood test and electrocardiogram (EKG) were performed. EKG, liver function tests, electrolytes, and whole blood count were within normal limits. Due to her isolation at home and selective food intake, levels of some vitamins were analyzed; vitamin D3 and folic acid levels were insufficient (vitamin D3: 20.9 ng/mL insufficient with levels above 30 ng/mL and folic acid: 2.3 ng/mL insufficient with levels above 3 ng/mL). The thyroid function test showed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels of 24.159 mIU/L (reference range: 0.400–4.00), free thyroxine (FT4) 0.93 ng/dL (reference range: 0.80–2.00), and triiodothyronine (T3) 1.08 ng/mL (reference range: 0.70–1.90), with antithyroid peroxidase antibodies >1300 IU/mL (reference range: <35).\nWe requested interconsultation with the endocrinology department where hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto's thyroiditis was diagnosed, and treatment with levothyroxine 50 micrograms/day was recommended. We began folic acid (5 mg/day) and vitamin D (0.266 mg/alternate days) supplementation too.\nDuring her hospital stay, the patient adapted well to the rules of the unit, was sociable with peers, and showed no behavioural disturbances at any time.\nAfter 8 days in our acute unit, the patient showed significant improvement in mood and social interaction and was discharged. Monitoring continued in the outpatient clinic, while the patient maintained the same pharmacological treatment. At six weeks, the patient was asymptomatic; she had returned to school showing acceptable performance and socialization with family and classmates. The new thyroid function test showed TSH 9.096 mIU/L and FT4 1.21 ng/dL. Six-months after discharge, the improvement persisted, and thyroid function was TSH 6.935 mIU/L and FT4 1.35 ng/dL and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies decreased, with 75 micrograms/day of levothyroxine.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?\n\nIdeal Body Weight: IBW = base_weight + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60), where base_weight is 50 kg for men and 45.5 kg for women",

On initial presentation, the patient's vitals were significant for heart rate of 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 190/100 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% with a non-rebreather mask at 15 liters. Physical exam was significant for moderate to severe respiratory distress, inspiratory stridor, and subcostal and intercostal retractions. Lungs were clear to auscultation. The patient was otherwise alert and oriented. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.447, pCO2 39, pO2 197, and HCO3 27 on 60% FiO2. His initial metabolic panel was significant for sodium 104 mmol/L, potassium 2.6 mmol/L, chloride 66 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 5 mg/dL (baseline 20 mg/dL), and creatinine 0.6 mg/dL (baseline 1.0 mg/dL). Glucose was 165 mg/dL. Magnesium and phosphorus were 1.1 and 2.1 mg/dL, respectively. Serum uric acid was low at 2.7 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed no leukocytosis or anemia. Urinalysis had a specific gravity of 1.010, moderate blood, and 15-29 red blood cells. Urine electrolytes were notable for a sodium of 48 mmol/L and osmolality of 217 mOsm/kg. Serum osmolality was 215 mOsm/kg. Urine and serum toxicology were negative for any substances. Alcohol level was negative.\nDue to concern for airway protection, the patient was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Initial chest x-ray held concern for infectious process, but antibiotics were stopped after infectious workup was negative. The patient was given two units of fresh-frozen plasma, famotidine, and Benadryl, and started on methylprednisolone 60 mg every six hours for angioedema. Lisinopril was held at this time. For his hyponatremia, the patient's labs were suspicious for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and a one-liter fluid restriction was initiated with nephrology consult. Thyroid and adrenal workup to rule out other causes of SIADH was unremarkable. A CT chest scan was done to evaluate for malignancy as a cause of SIADH, but did not demonstrate overt suspicious lung pathology (Figure ). The patient's hyponatremia appropriately corrected over the course of one week and was 130 mmol/L upon discharge. Lisinopril was discontinued and marked as an allergy for the patient.

The patient stated that she had ingested 40 tablets verapamil (contains 120 mg verapamil hydrochloride in each tablet) 10 h before the emergency service admission. The patient underwent continuous cardiac monitoring. Her serial electrocardiography (ECGs) were obtained. On her physical examination, her body weight was 60 kg and her height was 157 cm. She was lethargic, her arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate, respiration rate, and body temperature were measured as 57/32 mmHg, 50/min, 14/min, and 36.2°C, respectively. In the emergency department, gastric lavage and active charcoal treatment were not performed because she received the drug 10 h before the admission. 20 ml/kg 0.9% saline infusion has been given to the patient two times in the emergency department. The patient was taken to the PICU because her bradycardia and hypotension were resistant despite treatment. A central venous catheter was inserted quickly and 2500 ml/m2 hydration was started. In the laboratory analyses, complete blood count, renal function tests, serum electrolytes, and arterial blood gas analyses were taken, and all the results were within normal limits apart from elevated lactate levels (5.2 mml/L). Hyperglycemia was not found in the patient's blood glucose monitoring. In our follow-up, her general condition was poor and lethargic; bradycardia and ventricular extrasystoles were seen in the ECG []. She was in cardiogenic shock and dopamine infusion, at a rate of 10 mcg/kg/min was started, and calcium gluconate was given for CCB toxicity but her vital parameters did not change. Then, norepinephrine infusion therapy (0.1 mcg/kg/min) was started because she had peripheral vasodilatation symptoms and flushing. At the 2nd h of the patient's PICU hospitalization, we considered it appropriate to start ILE treatment, as the patient's hypotension and bradycardia continued, despite increased doses of inotropic drugs and calcium support. Intravenous lipid infusion (20% Intralipid) therapy was started at a rate of 1.5 ml/kg for 2 h. Half an hour after starting the ILE treatment, the patient's rhythm returned to the sinus rhythm, the ventricular extrasystoles disappeared on the patient's ECG and her arterial BP began to improve. The patient's BP was 79/52 mmHg when we started treatment. BPs were measured at 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h after the treatment had started, and the BPs were 84/56, 90/61, and 92/67 mmHg, respectively. Vital signs of the patient before and after ILE treatment are given in . After treatment, her inotropic drugs were gradually reduced within 8 h, and her consciousness began to recover very quickly. On the 2nd day of the intensive care stay, the patient was transferred to the cardiology service with complete neurological recovery and no organ failure.

            "input": "A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).\nThe patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.\nAt 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).\nThe patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.\nOn admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\nBone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.\nAfter bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?\n\nMaintenance Fluids Calculations: maintenance_fluid = base_value + weight_coefficient * weight, where base_value is 60 ml/hr for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 40 ml/hr for patients with a weight between 10kg and 20kg, and 0 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg, and weight_coefficient is 1 for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 2 for patients  with a weight between between 10kg and 20kg, and 4 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg",

She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.\nPatient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

            "input": "A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

Vital signs in the ED were temperature, 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 116/66 mmHg; heart rate, 130 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 30; oxygen saturation, 85% on 2 l nasal cannula; weight, 162 kg and body mass index, 47. Physical examination revealed a morbidly obese male in acute respiratory distress with an irregularly irregular pulse and one plus lower extremity pitting oedema. Laboratory values in the ED include white blood cell count, 9 800/μl; haemoglobin, 14.2 g/dl; platelet count, 230 000/μl; sodium, 140 mEq/l; potassium, 4.5 mEq/l; chloride, 104 mEq/l; bicarbonate, 29 mEq/l; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 38 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.4 mg/dl; glucose, 105 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 51 U/l; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 40 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 68 U/l; total bilirubin, 1.5 mg/dl; albumin, 3.4 g/dl; total protein, 7.1 g/dl; international normalised ratio (INR), 1.2; myoglobin, 97 μg/l; troponin, 0.07 ng/ml and B-type natriuretic peptide, 934 pg/ml. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Arterial blood gas showed a pH 7.33, paCO2 68.5 and paO2 88.6 on FiO2 of 40%. Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Echocardiogram revealed a myopathic severely enlarged left ventricular chamber with moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 8 to 10%. The patient's work of breathing and oxygenation improved with Bipap. He was started on diltiazem and diuresis was initiated. The patient was admitted to the step-down unit with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.\nOn hospital day number eight, the overnight nurse found the patient unresponsive. A code blue was called. His initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation and he was shocked with 200 J twice before regaining pulses. When stabilised, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he regained consciousness and full neurologic function within one hour of the event. The following day, an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was placed. Intraoperatively, the patient had runs of ventricular tachycardia with hypotension to 80 mmHg systolic. Postoperatively, the patient was found to have a right fixed mid-dilated pupil, flaccid paralysis of the left arm and leg with hyperreflexia throughout the left side. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed a right midbrain and thalamic stroke thought to be secondary to transient arrhythmia-induced hypoperfusion, intraoperatively.\nOn postoperative day number three, after AICD placement and stroke, the patient acutely developed a rigid distended board-like abdomen with dullness to percussion. Vitals at that time were temperature, 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 112/67 mmHg; heart rate range, 55 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 26 on ventilator settings of assist control volume control with a rate of 26; tidal volume, 500 ml; FiO2, 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5. His peak inspiratory pressure on the ventilator had risen from 26 to 72 mmHg; his plateau had risen from 15 to 48 mmHg with oxygen desaturation from 93 to 85%. The patient had received 1.5 l in and urinated 4.5 l over the 24 hours, leading up to this event. His laboratory values from that morning were unchanged from previous (white blood count, 10 400/μl; haemoglobin, 12.6 g/dl; platelets, 200 000/μl; sodium, 139 mEq/l; potassium, 4.7 mEq/l; chloride, 100 mEq/l; bicarbonate, 34 mEq/l; BUN, 36 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.41 mg/dl; glucose, 78 mg/dl; calcium, 8.3 mg/dl; magnesium, 2.0 mEq/l; phosphorus, 3.0 mg/dl; AST, 77 U/l; ALT, 94 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 186 U/l; total bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dl). This constellation of findings prompted the team to measure an abdominal compartment pressure which was elevated to 53 cm H2O (40 mmHg) with an abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) of 42 mmHg. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed no dilated loops of bowel, no ileus, no evidence of free air, abscess or obstruction and minimal free fluid []. Pertinent labs from the event revealed a lactate of 1.0 mg/dl; lipase, 159 U/l; amylase, 76 U/l; creatinine, 1.53 mg/dl. Surgery was consulted and the FiO2 was increased to 100%, which improved his oxygen saturation to 96% despite his elevated peak inspiratory pressures.\nSurgical recommendations were for an emergent bedside surgical abdominal decompression. The patient was administered 10 mg of intravenous cisatracurium besylate by anaesthesia in preparation for surgical management. Shortly following paralytic administration, his peak inspiratory pressure corrected from 72 to 23 mmHg, his plateau pressure from 48 to 16 mmHg and his oxygenation status tolerated a decrease in FiO2 down to 40% with his oxygen saturation returning to baseline. Measurement of his abdominal compartment pressure revealed a drop from 53 (40 mmHg) to 23 cm H2O (17 mmHg) and then normalised to 15 cm H20 (11 mmHg) over a three-hour period. During this entire event, the patient averaged 100 to 200 cc/hr of urine output and laboratory values from the following day showed a drop in creatinine from 1.53 to 1.29 mg/dl. Given this correction, surgical management was postponed and the patient was monitored. The patient remained hospitalised for an additional 73 days. He was ultimately transferred to a skilled nursing facility without return of symptoms.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?\n\nAlbumin Corrected Anion Gap: albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL))",

            "input": "An 83-year-old man with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency room shortly before midnight with sharp chest pain, nausea, and dyspnea. The patient states he has had chest discomfort and food intolerance for the past week, but that his symptoms were far worse tonight. He notes no inciting event, recent trauma, or aggravating factors. On exam he appears uncomfortable, anxious, and is in a semi-tripod position. Vitals are pertinent for a heart rate of 144, systolic blood pressure in the 180 s, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 1L O2 via nasal cannula. Of note, the patient weighed 67.2 kg, and was 173 cm tall. Chart review showed that he had lost approximately 4 kg (last recorded weight in chart was 71.2 kg), since his last medical visit.\nPrimary survey was overall unremarkable. Airway was secure, patient’s breathing improved with 3 L oxygen, breath sounds were present and equal bilaterally, vascular access was obtained, and GCS was 15. Intravenous pain medication was given which improved the patient’s blood pressure to systolic 140 s. Given this patient’s overall clinical picture, the most pressing disease processes included myocardial infarction (given history of coronary artery disease and prior infarcts), aortic dissection (given symptoms, hypertension, and medical history), pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (the previous two diagnoses given his chest pain and decreased O2 even on 1 L of oxygen), and cardiac wall rupture (given multiple prior MIs). Other considerations include congestive heart failure, hypertensive crisis, and an underlying infection.\nLabs were drawn to include a CBC, renal panel, cardiac panel, lactate, and a type and cross. EKG was unremarkable. A chest X-ray was obtained which revealed a widened mediastinum (Fig. ).\nThe patient was stabilized, but the underlying cause of his symptoms had not yet been identified. His widened mediastinum is troubling, and further drives the differential. Aortic (dissection, aneurysm), cardiac (tamponade, wall rupture), and esophageal pathology (rupture versus other masses) now move to the top of the list of diagnoses. Labs continued to be pending. Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ).\nAlong with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL. Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia. Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals. Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus. No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported.\nThe findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient. Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient. The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects. The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter. In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal.\nOn EGD, the patient’s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter. The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it. The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient’s lab derangements (Fig. ).\nThe decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device. About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL). A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning. Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus. In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage). He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nThe patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night. The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition. The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan. The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity. An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization.\nThe patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor. During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization. He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ). After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis. Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient’s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning). He was followed up in the outpatient setting for further management.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

            "input": "A 66-year-old female presented with nontraumatic, chronic dull-aching low back pain with worsening symptoms for the previous one year. The pain affected her walking such that she was “waddling” to avoid the pain. On occasions the pain would radiate to the right leg as well as anterior and lateral thigh but not past the knee. There were no associated paresthesias or significant weakness. She denied history of cancer, weight loss, fever, chills, or night sweats. There was no history of nephrolithiasis or bone fractures. She was being treated for diabetes and hypertension. She had history of pulmonary emboli of unclear etiology in the 1990 s. Surgical history included cholecystectomy in 1994, uterine endometrial ablation in 1996, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgeries. She had an allergy to penicillin causing a rash and an intolerance to sulfa causing abdominal discomfort. The patient reported remote history of smoking for 15 years, quitting 25 years ago. Family history was negative for bone disease. Physical exam was remarkable for her being overweight. She had a side-to-side waddle in her gait and slightly lifted her feet on walking. Straight leg raising test was negative. She did not have tenderness to percussion of the lower back but did have a gibbous at L-4. There was no back pain with movement. She had weakness at the iliopsoas and quadriceps bilaterally but no loss of sensation. An outside MRI of the lumbar spine showed an infiltrative lesion in the L-4 vertebra with collapse of the body (confirmed on repeat MRI at our institution, ). CT scan confirmed a pathologic fracture of L-4 with a lytic lesion. A bone scan showed mildly increased radiotracer uptake at L-4, and additional uptake was seen in several lower thoracic ribs bilaterally, as well as the xiphoid process, upper right femur, and skull, suggesting metabolic bone disease. The L-4 lesion was hypermetabolic on PET scan (). Initial CT guided biopsy of the lesion was nondiagnostic demonstrating only bone, fibrous tissue, and cartilage. Laboratory testing was remarkable for low serum phosphorus of 1.5 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL). Additional abnormalities included elevated serum calcium of 10.6 mg/dL (8.9–10.1 mg/dL), inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (PTH) of 120 pg/mL (15–65 pg/mL), low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D of <8 pg/mL (18–78 pg/mL), and mildly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase of 162 u/L (45–115 u/L). Serum albumin was normal at 4.0 g/dL (3.5–5.0 g/dL), serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1 mg/dL), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D was normal at 31 ng/mL (25–80 ng/mL). She had frank phosphaturia, especially for her level of serum phosphorus (772 mg, normal 0–1,099 mg). 24-hour urine calcium was low at 10 mg (20–275 mg). Serum and urinary protein electrophoresis with immunofixation were normal. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was normal at 2.12 mIU/L (0.3–5.0 mIU/L). Parathyroid scan was normal. Plasma FGF-23 from a peripheral vein was significantly elevated at 3,500 RU/mL (<180 RU/mL), confirming TIO. Oral phosphate supplementation and calcitriol were prescribed. She was subsequently lost to followup from our medical center for two years, and when she returned, she reported that she had internal fixation with a rod placement for a spontaneous right femur fracture. She also had deep pain in her left thigh and was told by a local provider that she had a “brown tumor” in the left femur based on plain radiographs. She had not been taking phosphate supplements or calcitriol on a regular basis. Repeat laboratory investigations continued to show a significantly low phosphorus of 1.4 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL), high serum calcium of 10.6 mg/dL (8.9–10.1 mg/dL), elevated PTH of 229.1 pg/mL (10–65 pg/mL), and serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (0.6–1.1 mg/dL). Plasma FGF-23 level remained significantly elevated at 4,460 RU/mL (<180 RU/mL). A repeat CT guided needle biopsy of L-4 showed a low grade spindle cell neoplasm with positive FGF-23 mRNA expression by RT-PCR (), confirming the diagnosis of mixed phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor (PMT). She suffered a spontaneous left peritrochanteric fracture requiring placement of an intramedullary device. The patient then elected to have surgery involving anterior resection of the L-4 vertebral body to complete total spondylectomy at this spinal level, along with corpectomy. Pathology of the resection specimen confirmed a spindle cell neoplasm consistent with PMTMCT. Six months after surgical resection, she was independent in activities of daily living but was using a walker for ambulation due to some difficulty walking and right foot drop. She was prescribed physical therapy. Follow-up laboratory testing revealed normal serum phosphorus at 2.5 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL) and calcium of 9.6 mg/dL (8.9–10.1 mg/dL). PTH was 619 pg/mL (10–65 pg/mL). This is on minimal phosphate supplementation without calcitriol. Repeat plasma FGF-23 level remained elevated but had greatly decreased to 422 RU/mL (<180 RU/mL).\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

The patient had been suffering dyspnea on exertion for three years. His vital signs were blood pressure (BP) 130–150/70–80 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 80–100 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) 18–22 rates/min, and body temperature 36.2℃. The patient's oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2) while receiving air was 75–89%, which was partially corrected to 91–98% while receiving 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal prong (VNP). Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) under oxygen administration revealed the following: pH 7.39, arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) 44.6 mmHg, arterial O2 partial pressure(PaO2) 65.3 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3–) 26.1 mEq/L.\nDuring induction, both mask ventilation and intubation were difficult (laryngeal view: Cormack-Lehane grade IV). Intubation trials with a 37-Fr. left-sided double lumen tube (DLT) (Mallinckrodt™, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) and laryngoscopy, followed by a videostylet (Optiscope®, Pacific Medical, Seoul, Korea) failed. Hence, a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was used to intubate a single lumen tube (SLT) (ID 8.0), and then the SLT was changed to a DLT using a tube exchanger.\nLeft one-lung ventilation (OLV) was maintained with an SpO2 of 86–90% at an inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2) of 1.0 during right-lung lavage. We performed external percussion physiotherapy with an automatic mechanical percussion device (The Vest™ Model 205 [Airway Clearance System], frequency 10 Hz, duration 3 minutes, Hill-Rom, Charleston, SC, USA) rather than manual chest percussion. After right-lung lavage, we resumed two-lung ventilation (TLV) with intermittent suction for 20 minutes (FIO2 1.0). For left-lung lavage, right OLV was started with an FIO2 of 1.0, but it was impossible to maintain SpO2 > 80% (). Therefore, we decided to postpone left-lung lavage until conditions in the right lung improved (). A chest X-ray taken after intensive care unit (ICU) transfer showed no specific findings, including pneumothorax. One day after the lavage, while in the ICU, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation, extubated, and transferred to the general ward.\nThree days later, the patient was returned to the operating room for left-lung lavage. The patient's SpO2 was 91–96% with O2 3 L/min VNP. We intubated the trachea with a SLT via Glide-Scope (Verathon Medical, British Columbia, Canada) and then changed the SLT to a DLT with a tube exchanger because the previous intubation was difficult. We confirmed breath sounds from both lungs, and right and left lung ventilation during separation through auscultation. The proper tube location was confirmed using an FOB.\nTLV was performed in volume-controlled mode: FIO2 1.0, tidal volume of 400 ml, RR of 15 rates/min, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 31 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. PaO2 was 57 mmHg (SpO2 86%) on ABGA examination. Fifty minutes after induction, we started right OLV in pressure-controlled mode: FIO2 1.0, inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O above PEEP 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 200 ml, and RR of 20 /min. Within a few minutes of starting right OLV, the patient's SpO2 plunged below 80%, so we rapidly resumed TLV and re-confirmed the proper position of the DLT using an FOB. We did not observe any bronchial secretion or obstruction. Right OLV was tried again, but the patient's SpO2 rapidly decreased to < 80% within a few minutes. After resuming TLV, 2.5 mg of salbutamol was nebulized to relieve any bronchial constriction, and 100 mg of hydrocortisone was injected intravenously to improve symptoms. During manual ventilation, we detected very poor lung compliance. In auscultation, the patient's breath sounds from the right lung were very distant and nearly inaudible. Therefore, we suspected he had a right-side pneumothorax, which was confirmed on chest X-ray (). A chest tube was inserted by a thoracic surgeon, and a follow-up chest X-ray showed that the pneumothorax had decreased (). Two hours after induction, lung compliance and arterial oxygenation improved: FIO2 1.0, tidal volume of 450 ml, RR of 18/min, PIP of 24 cmH2O, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. PaO2 improved to 93 mmHg on the following ABGA examination ().\nWe re-tried right OLV and were finally able to maintain SpO2 > 90%: FIO2 1.0, inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O above PEEP 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 320 ml, and RR of 20 /min, without any severe air leakage or tidal-volume loss. The left-lung lavage was started along with right OLV with the chest tube inserted state. During the remaining lavage period, we maintained SpO2 > 85% without further deterioration.\nAfter lavage, the patient was transferred to the ICU and received mechanical ventilation. On postoperative day (POD) 1, the patient developed a high fever (38.8℃) and was diagnosed as having pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion in the right lower lobe, so antibiotics were administered. The chest tube was removed on POD 3, and extubation was performed on POD 4. The patient was transferred to the general ward on POD 7 and discharged on POD 19. Follow-up chest computed tomography was performed 40 days after the left-lung lavage; it showed interval decreases in the extent of PAP in both lungs, resolved parenchymal consolidation in the right lung, and decreased right pleural effusion ().\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?\n\nIdeal Body Weight: IBW = base_weight + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60), where base_weight is 50 kg for men and 45.5 kg for women",

The abdomen was generally tender without signs of peritonitis; bowel sounds were normal. The ECG showed no abnormalities. Routine laboratory tests revealed mild leucocytosis and a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level. Troponin, myoglobine, and creatine kinase levels were within normal limits.

She had taken only the prescribed acetaminophen one day before. According to her past medical history, she went to kindergarten, had not traveled recently, had no history of pancreatitis, autoimmune disease, choledochal cyst, or pancreatic ductal abnormalities, and her family history was negative for pancreatic disease. She has one older sister, and her sister did not have symptoms such as fever. Her vital signs at admission were as follows: blood pressure, 97/60 mmHg; heart rate, 104 beats/min; respiration rate, 24 breaths/min; and body temperature, 37.4℃. Her height was 98 cm (50th–75th percentile), and her weight was 15 kg (50th–75th percentile). On physical examination, multiple vesicles on the soft palate and maculopapular rashes were observed on both the hands and feet. She had a clear breathing sound, regular heartbeat without murmur, and soft abdomen with a normoactive bowel sound without an abdominal mass or abdominal tenderness. In initial laboratory studies, the serum glucose was decreased (41 mg/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate was slightly increased (17 mm/hr; reference range, 0–10 mm/hr), and C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (12.9 mg/L; reference range, 0.0–5.0 mg/L), and other laboratory studies were within the normal ranges. The white blood cell count was 7.8×103/µL, hemoglobin was 12.6 g/dL, platelet count was 252×103/µL, blood urea nitrogen was 15.0 mg/dL, creatinine was 0.42 mg/dL, cholesterol was 187 mg/dL, albumin was 4.3 g/dL, total bilirubin was 0.39 mg/dL, direct bilirubin was 0.11 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase was 34 IU/L, alanine aminotransaminase was 10 IU/L, sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 4.4 mmol/L. Amylase and lipase tests were not performed at the time of admission. Urine ketone body was 3 positive in urinalysis. A chest X-ray showed no active lung lesions, cardiopulmonary angle blunting, or cardiomegaly. Abdomen X-rays showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern without ileus or pancreatic calcification.\nWe treated the child conservatively with intravenous fluid. On the first hospital day (HD), her fever subsided. On the third HD, she complained of ear pain caused by acute otitis media and intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanate was administered at a dose of 90 mg/kg/day. On the fourth HD, she experienced severe epigastric pain and vomiting. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 107/80 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min.; respiration rate, 24 breaths/min; and body temperature, 37.2℃. On physical examination, she complained of epigastric tenderness. The serum levels of amylase and lipase were remarkably elevated (amylase, 1,902 IU/L; reference range, 28–100 IU/L; lipase, >1,500 IU/L; reference range, 13–60 IU/L). Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed mild diffuse swelling of the pancreas from head to tail with a small amount of ascites (), which suggested acute pancreatitis.\nConsidering the patient's history of HFMD, we thought that enterovirus, which is a common cause of HFMD, could be a pathogen. We asked the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for enterovirus typing of her stool sample. In the first step, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on the specimens targeting the 5' noncoding region capable of detecting all 68 serotypes, and the result was enterovirus-positive. In the second step, 2-step RT-PCR was performed targeting viral protein 1, which has a different structural enterovirus protein for each subtype, and CA16 was detected in the sample.\nAfter acute pancreatitis was diagnosed, the patient was fasted and given sufficient intravenous fluid. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were given for pain control. Serum amylase and lipase were serially followed (). The fever, epigastric pain, and vomiting were recovered on the sixth HD. She was discharged on the 11th HD without pancreatitis-related complications. On the day of discharge, the serum levels of amylase and lipase were remarkably reduced (amylase, 289 IU/L; lipase, 893 IU/L).\nShe was followed up after discharge without any symptoms, and pancreatitis has not recurred yet.

He was brought to our hospital after starting on dexamethasone and abiraterone acetate without improvement of serum prostate specific antigen level for two months in a medical center nearby.\nThere was no obvious bone pain, chills or fever. He denied other major systemic disease except essential hypertension under regular medical control. His chest X-ray film disclosed right side costophrenic angle blunting and a little fluid accumulation in the minor fissure without extensive pulmonary edema. Blood chemistry showed that levels of alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within normal ranges. Abnormal results included alkaline phosphatase of 123 iu/L (normal 32 to 91), albumin of 3.2 g/dL (normal 3.5 to 4.8) and calcium of 7.7 mg/dL (normal 8.6 to 10). Serum prostate specific antigen level was 905 ng/mL (normal 0 to 4). Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (41.2 sec, control 31.5) and prothrombin time (international normalized ratio 1.23) were noted. Although plasma fibrinogen level was still normal (335 mg/dL, normal 200 to 400), the concentration of D-dimer was extremely high (over 20,000 ng/mL, normal less than 500).

The patient was referred to the department of internal medicine for consultation on the day of admission. This patient’s medical history included medial osteoarthritis of the left knee, lumbar spinal canal stenosis, and an L2 vertebral fracture two years before admission. There were no malignant findings. She was followed by her general practitioner for blood tests every six months.

Considering further rapid progression, steroids were urgently administered on the third day of admission due to suspicion of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephropathy. This was performed prior to a bone marrow biopsy and immunofixation electrophoresis. Considering renal atrophy and renal damage due to malignancy, an abdominal CT, head MRI, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed. However, there was no renal atrophy, and no obvious malignant findings were observed (Figure ). Additional tests for antinuclear antibody, anti-streptolysin 0 antibody, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, and anticardiolipin antibody were all normal. The serum immunoelectrophoresis that we had submitted on the second day of admission came back on the eighth day, and the IgG, IgA, and IgM had decreased. On the twentieth day of admission, a renal biopsy of the right kidney was performed. Crystals in the tubules and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-negative urinary casts suggested acute kidney injury associated with cast nephropathy (Figures -). Additional investigations were performed to determine the cause of the cast nephropathy. On the 33rd day of admission, Bence-Jones protein-λ M protein was detected in the urine. And IgD-λ M protein and Bence-Jones protein-λ protein were detected on the 36th day (Figure ). Additional blood data showed a λ type free light chain of 8440 mg/L (κ/λ ratio of <0.001). This indicated light chain MM or monoclonal gammaglobulinemia (MGRS). Bone marrow examination showed scattered plasma cell nests of 23%, which was consistent with MM (Figure ). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with IgD-λ type MM. There were indications for treatment. However, based on a discussion with a hematologist, it was concluded that active treatment for myeloma would not improve the patient’s condition. This patient was bedridden and her condition was poor. The side effects of the treatment could have impinged on her appetite and condition. When we discussed this with the patient, she refused to undergo chemotherapy or further active treatment. As a result of this discussion, we decided to treat her with palliative measures. For the anemia, we employed a blood transfusion and a darbepoetin alfa injection. Maintenance dialysis was initiated for the chronic renal failure. As it was difficult for the patient to return home, she was admitted to a nursing care facility.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta ratio?\n\nDelta Ratio: delta_ratio = delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

He had no respiratory, neurological, rheumatological, ophthalmologic, or dermatological symptoms. Physical examination showed a pale child with weight and height both below the 3rd percentile for age. Laboratory investigations were remarkable for anemia (hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), ESR 114 mm/h, serum calcium 2.26 mmol/L, and low albumin level 28 g/L. Endoscopy revealed an erosive, friable, and nodular gastric mucosa over the entire stomach. Histopathology of biopsies revealed chronic noncaseating granulomatous inflammation []. Special stains and cultures for acid-fast and fungal microorganisms showed negative results. Colonoscopy was normal including terminal ileum. CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated multiple, small, centrolobularly distributed nodules within the acini of both lungs and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Ophthalmological examination showed evidence of uveitis. ACE level was elevated at 135 U/L. Similar to Case 1, extensive investigations for infectious, immunologic, and inflammatory conditions associated with GIT granulomatous inflammation were negative.\nThe combination of tissue findings of granulomatous disease from upper GIT, elevated ACE, systemic involvement, and negative workup for infectious disease suggested systemic sarcoidosis with significant GI involvement. The patient received corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg/day and omeprazole, resulting in resolution of GI symptoms and normalization of activity markers and ACE level. Tapering of corticosteroids over 3 months led to relapse of the disease. Again, remission was induced by a course of steroids supplemented by mesalamine (Pentasa 50 mg/kg/day) and azathioprine (up to 2.5 mg/kg/day) to maintain remission. Throughout the 4-year follow up, the course of the disease was punctuated by several relapses on tapering of corticosteroids and later development of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia: hemoglobin 10.6 gm/dL, macrocytosis (MCV 102, normal 80–91 fL), hyperchromasia (MCH 34.5, normal 20–31 pg), low serum vitamin B12 119.2 pmol/L (normal 162–638 pmol/L). Red blood cell folate level was normal at 16.2 nmol/L (normal, 10.4–42.2 nmol/L). Antigastric parietal cell antibodies were negative. The patient received weekly injections of vitamin B12 ( 1 mg weekly) for 6 weeks that raised the level to 231.8 pmol/L with correction of anemia and normalization of his peripheral blood picture.\nConsidering the steroid dependency of the disease and the short stature of the patient, he was commenced on infliximab 5 mg/kg administered intravenously at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and then every 8 weeks. The patient reported a significant subjective general improvement as well as resolution of his GI symptoms. ESR and ACE concentration returned to normal. A repeat of endoscopy after the 6th dose of infliximab infusion demonstrated loss of gastric folds pattern and loss of normal vascular pattern; otherwise there were no more erosions or friability. Biopsies from the gastric mucosa showed a marked reduction of inflammation, atrophic gastric glands, and absence of granulomas. At 5 years posttreatment with infliximab, the patient remains in remission off corticosteroids.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

The patient had suffered difficulties in walking from weakening of both lower limb muscles since 25 years ago, and recently the symptom of weakness of lower limb muscles became more serious and dyspnea at the level of ATS (American Thoracic Society) Dyspnea Grade I had occurred due to the weakening of the respiratory root. A molecular genetics examination conducted at another hospital discovered a deficit of the SMN1 gene, and considering the time of onset and clinical conditions, the patient was diagnosed with type IV spinal muscular atrophy. The patient stood 168 cm and weighed 63 kg, and there were no special opinions from ECG and simple radioactive examination before operation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed pH 7.435, PaO2 74.6 mmHg, PaCO2 36.9 mmHg, and HCO3- 24.2 mmHg. The patient was under drug treatment for hypertension. Administration before anesthesia was not conducted and vital signs examined after going into the operating room were blood pressure: 160/100 mmHg; respiration rate per minute: 20 times; ECG: normal sinus rhythm; and pulse oxymetry: 98%. From a manual muscle test before operation, both legs were at the 4th stage. At the genupectoral position, the epidural space was identified by loss of resistance technique using an 18 G Tuohy insertion needle in between the L2-L3 lumbar, and after a test dose injection of 1.5% lidocaine 3 ml containing 1 : 200,000 epinephrine, no increase of heart rate or spinal anesthesia symptom was detected. After injecting 0.75% ropivacaine 12 ml, a catheter was placed and maintained. To measure the level of motor block by time after anesthesia, a modified Bromage scale (0: One can stretch and raise his/her leg; 1: One cannot raise his/her leg and cannot bend his/her knee; 2: One cannot his/her knee but can bend his/her ankle; 3: One cannot bend his/her ankle) was applied.\nThe level of modified Bromage scale before anesthesia was 1, and 20 minutes after injecting ropivacaine, the level of modified Bromage scale was 3. The sensory nerves were blocked by T8 segment on pinprick examination. Vital signs during operation were blood pressure: 120-140/60-80 mmHg and pulse rate per minute: stable at 70-80 times. A Venti® mask with 35% of oxygen fraction in inspired air was used, and an ETCO2 capnometer was placed under the nose of the patient to monitor the end-tidal CO2. ETCO2 was stable at 35 mmHg and the pulse oxymetry was 100%. Due to the risk of aspiration of saliva or bronchial secretion during operation, sedation was not operated. The surgery was operated for an hour, and the epidural catheter was removed after operation. After finishing the operation, the level of modified Bromage scale was 3 and the sensory nerve block was decreased up to the T9 segment. Three hours after the operation, the level of modified Bromage scale was dropped to 2 and the sensory nerve block to the T11 segment; 5 hours after the operation, the stage of modified Bromage scale was 1, and the sensory nerve was declined to the L1 segment. Since the patient did not show adverse effects including vomiting, nausea, and dizziness in the recovery room, he was moved to a patient room. Twelve hours after finishing the operation, both the level of the modified Bromage scale and sensory nerve were recovered to the condition before operation, and also for the manual muscle test, both legs were maintained at the 4th stage. A physical exam conducted 24 hours after finishing surgery did not show special opinions.

            "input": "A 3-month-old 1.1 kg female domestic short-haired cat presented with a 3-week history of seizure and generalized pain. The cat had been fed on a commercial kitten food. The cat was examined by the referring veterinarian because of its seizures and reluctance to move for 2 weeks before its initial presentation. The cat’s serum biochemistry profile revealed hypocalcemia (total calcium 1.27 mmol/L; reference range 1.97–2.82 mmol/L) and high alkaline phosphatase (835 U/L; reference range 14–192 U/l), aspartate transaminase (70 U/L; reference range 0–32 U/L), total bilirubin (3.4 mg/dL; reference range 0–0.9 mg/dL), and creatine kinase (3470 U/L; reference range 0–394 U/L). Urea and creatinine were within the reference range (Table ). The complete blood count revealed no abnormalities, and the tests results for feline leukemia virus antigen and antibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus were negative. Based on these results, the referring veterinarian suspected that the cause of the seizures was related to hypocalcemia. Therefore, the cat was treated with levetiracetam (20 mg/kg, IV, BID) and calcium gluconate 8.5% (0.5 ml/kg, PO, BID) for 2 weeks, but its clinical condition did not improve.\nOn initial examination, the cat was lethargic and reluctant to move. Her appetite was good, but defecation appeared to be painful. Her family history, including whether the parents and littermates were alive, was unknown. Serum biochemistry revealed that both the total and ionized calcium levels were low (total calcium 1.55 mmol/L; reference range 2.05–3.02 mmol/L, ionized calcium 0.74 mmol/L; reference range 1.20–1.35 mmol/L). Radiographs showed skeletal demineralization and the presence of abnormally wide growth plates on the long bones (Fig. ). The differential diagnosis for hypocalcemia with skeletal abnormalities includes primary hypoparathyroidism, nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal secondary hyperparathyroidism, intestinal malabsorption, and VDDR. However, the cat had previously eaten a well-balanced commercial kitten food (Science Diet kitten, Hill’s Colgate Japan) before becoming obviously ill, so nutritional deficiency seemed highly unlikely. The levels of parathyroid hormone (Immulyze intact PTH III, Simens) and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D RIA Kit FR, Immunodiagnostic Systems) were determined as elements of the differential diagnosis of hypocalcemia. The parathyroid hormone level was high (99.7 pg/ml; reference range 8.0–25.0 pg/ml), but 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (23.1 pg/ml) was low compared with the levels of healthy cats (Table ). The urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.032 and traces of protein. No bacterial growth was detected in the urine culture. Consequently, VDDR was suspected to be the cause of hypocalcemia and skeletal abnormalities in this cat.\nOn the day after the initial examination, the cat experienced seizures suspected of being hypocalcemic in origin. Slow administration of calcium gluconate 8.5% IV (1 ml/kg) was commenced, and the cat was continuously monitored by ECG, but no arrhythmia was detected. Several calcium gluconate 8.5% (1 ml/kg, IV) treatment stopped the seizures, but neither her total calcium nor her ionized calcium level increased sufficiently. Therefore, the cat was administered 8.5% calcium gluconate (starting dose, 1.0 ml/kg/h) in 0.9% saline solution by continuous rate infusion (CRI) (Table ).\nStarting on day 2, the cat received alfacalcidol (Onealfa Tablets) by CRI of 8.5% calcium gluconate. However, she did not respond well to treatment with the standard dose (0.01–0.03 μg/kg, PO, SID) of alfacalcidol so the CRI of 8.5% calcium gluconate was stopped. The final dose of alfacalcidol was very large, and 1 μg/kg, PO, TID was required to maintain the cat’s general condition in the absence of CRI of 8.5% calcium gluconate (Table ). On day 16, the cat was discharged from hospital. Radiographs were taken again 2.5 months after the initial treatment was started. The cat’s bone structure was still abnormal, but showed marked improvement (Fig. ).\nThe hypocalcemia, low 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, radiographic changes, and poor response to alphacalcidol led us to suspect a genetic abnormality of vitamin D metabolism in this cat. In humans and cats, type 2 VDDR is characterized by high 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels. In the cat examined in the present study, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol was lower than in healthy cats, and a huge dose of alfacalcidol was required to maintain her serum calcium concentration. Hence, we decided to analyze the gene sequences of CYP2R1 (ENSEMBL Gene ID ENSFCAG00000011383) and CYP27B1 (ENSEMBL Gene ID ENSFCAG00000014701) in healthy control cats (2 intact males and a spayed female, all domestic short-haired cats owned by our veterinary teaching hospital staff) and the affected this cat. The feline CYP2R gene contains five exons encoding an enzyme of 501 amino acids, and the CYP27B1 gene contains nine exons encoding an enzyme of 508 amino acids. We designed primer pairs for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the individual exons and the immediate flanking regions of CYP2R1 and CYP27B1. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood samples with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). PCR amplification of the fragments was performed with 20 ng of genomic DNA in GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega), which also contained the primer pair (10 μM each) and water, with 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C (Table ). The PCR product sizes were verified as correct by agarose gel electrophoresis separation, the products were prepared for sequencing using the FastGene Gel/PCR Extraction Kit (Nippon Genetics), and then sequenced by a commercial DNA sequencing service (Fasmac). The sequences from the healthy cats and the affected cat were compared, and although no abnormalities in the CYP27B1 gene were present in the affected cat, we did identify the CYP2R1 variant in exon 5; c.1380G > G/A and c.1386del in this cat (Fig. ). The variant, where T is deleted at position c.1386, causes a frameshift mutation in the gene, resulting in chain termination at the position encoding amino acid 481 in the full-length 501 amino acid protein (p.Phe462Leufs*20). The partial sequence of CYP2R1 exon 5 in this cat has been available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession number LC424161. We next searched for the structural information for proteins affected by this nonsynonymous mutation using the protein database HOMOCOS (). The amino acid sequences between human and feline CYP2R1 were almost identical (96.7% identity) and all contact sites with vitamin D3 were conserved (Additional file ). Therefore, we referred an already-known crystal structure of human CYP2R1-vitamin D3 complex (pdb ID 3c6g) []. Two contact sites (amino acids 487 and 488) in the CYP2R1-vitamin D3 complex were missing in the sequence from the affected cat (Additional file ), suggesting that the T deletion in exon 5 of CYP2R1 linked with a remarkable loss of CYP2R1 protein function in this cat.\nAfter the CYP2R1 variant was identified, the affected cat was treated with a standard dose of calcitriol (Caldemin; 2.5–3.5 ng/kg, PO, SID), which restored the total and ionized calcium levels to within the reference range. The level of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol at − 80 °C stored serum sample of initial presentation was additionally measured using a commercial ELISA kit (HVD3 ELISA Kit, MyBioSource). The low level of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (12 nmol/L) compared with the levels of healthy cats (Table ) is likely to type 1B VDDR in humans [–].\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?\n\nMaintenance Fluids Calculations: maintenance_fluid = base_value + weight_coefficient * weight, where base_value is 60 ml/hr for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 40 ml/hr for patients with a weight between 10kg and 20kg, and 0 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg, and weight_coefficient is 1 for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 2 for patients  with a weight between between 10kg and 20kg, and 4 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg",

Her renal function quickly improved on day two of admission to a creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL and CrCl of 56.5 mL/min. She was initially started on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and later changed to IV cefepime due to her urine culture, sensitivity pattern, and renal recovery (Figure ). A PICC line was placed and the patient was discharged with IV cefepime. She had completed a 10-day course of cefepime just one day prior to the current admission.\nDuring this admission, initial vitals were temperature 35.8ºC, heart rate 68 beats per minute, respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and blood pressure 81/54 mmHg. Her systolic blood pressures were in 80s for the last two to three months prior to admission and was maintained on home midodrine. This was attributed to autonomic dysfunction secondary to neuromyelitis optica after extensive workup. Examination was notable for expressive aphasia and altered mental status. She was also found to have AKI with elevated creatinine of 2.19 mg/dL (baseline 0.6 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen of 68 mg/dL (baseline 7 mg/dL), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 23 mL/min/1.73 m2 (baseline >60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Electrolyte levels were serum sodium 145 mmol/L (baseline 141 mmol/L), serum potassium 4.4 mmol/L (baseline 4.3 mmol/L), serum chloride 108 mmol/L (baseline 104 mmol/L), and serum bicarbonate 18 mmol/L (baseline 26 mmol/L). Her urine output was decreased to 600 mL in 24 hours. Brain computed tomography did not show any acute intracranial findings. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed an interval increase in the size of the right centrum semi-ovale and a hyperintense demyelinating lesion without enhancement which ruled out an acute demyelinating process (Figure ).\nShe continued to become more lethargic over the next few hours and developed jerking of the left upper extremity and face. Medical management to treat the seizures was partially successful. Serum cefepime levels were measured and found to be elevated at 295 mg/L. After three hours of hemodialysis, cefepime levels improved from 295 mg/L to 70 mg/L. She was then started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for ongoing clearance of cefepime.

The symptoms had aggravated, and he had been unable to keep supine position for the last 3 days. He denied any previous heart disease. He had a history of right elbow leiomyosarcoma and underwent resection surgery 1 year previously.\nOn physical examination, the patient showed orthopnea and a compulsive position of slight left tilting. Wet rales could be heard on bilateral lung base. III/6 diastolic rumble was heard through the apex of the heart, which attenuated with upright position.\nThe preoperative laboratory data were within normal limits, except for NT-proBNP 1,190 pg/L. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and minor ST segment change. Chest X-ray demonstrated prominent pulmonary patches infiltration, suggesting possible pulmonary edema. A mass was noted on the left lung. Combined with the malignancy history of the patient, pulmonary metastasis was suspected, whereas primary pulmonary tumor could not be ruled out (). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a mobile isoechoic to hyperechoic lumpy mass (54×27 mm, ) and medium pulmonary hypertension (67 mmHg), and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle was 65%.\nAccording to symptoms of left-sided heart failure, signs of mitral stenosis, and ultrasound imaging, myxoma was highly suspected. The TTE image indicated that the mass originated from the posterior wall of the left atrium (the typical myxoma is pedunculated with a stalk commonly attached to the fossa ovalis of interatrial septum). Differential diagnoses included idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), pulmonary embolism, pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is not enough evidence to support the differential diagnoses above.\nIn the operating room, monitors consisting of noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), five-lead electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) were applied. Radial arterial line and central venous catheter in the right subclavian vein were inserted, and then, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were monitored. Vital signs of the patient were basically stable with continuous intravenous nitroglycerin at the rate of 0.5 μg/kg/min. ABP was 121/82 mmHg, and CVP was 8 cmH2O, while heart rate (HR) was 111 bpm. His SpO2 was 92%–93% (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] 60%). Airway assessment indicated several risk factors: obesity, short neck, impaired neck mobility, and Mallampati classification grade III. When the patient was awake with topical anesthesia of the tongue and pharynx, partial glottis was observed (Cormack–Lehane 2b) with direct laryngoscope. Thus, we considered the mask ventilation was feasible and anesthesia induction was conducted. After preoxygenation with oxygen (10 L/min) for 5 min via a face mask, general anesthesia was induced using Renfushufen® (sufentanil) 1 μg/kg, etomidate 0.15 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (ideal body weight). Orotracheal intubation was performed with video laryngoscope when the patient was kept in the 60° Semi-Fowler’s position to avoid circulation collapse. Because mitral valve occlusion by left atrial mass may result in low cardiac output. Volume-controlled ventilation was applied (tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, frequency adjusted to maintain partial pressure of carbon dioxide in artery [PaCO2] between 35 and 45 mmHg, and inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio 1:2). The airway peak pressure was 28–30 cmH2O. After intubation, the SpO2 was only 90%–93% (FiO2 60%). Arterial gas analysis during surgery is shown in . Abnormalities of airway, breathing, drug effects, and equipment were not found; thus, pulmonary edema was considered as the main reason for hypoxia. FiO2 100% was provided to improve oxygenation. Respiratory rate was increased to enhance minute ventilation volume. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was supplied to prevent alveoli from collapsing to improve pulmonary compliance and gas exchange and to decrease extravascular lung water. PEEP was titrated to 6 cmH2O to avoid high PEEP-related compromise preload. Then, SpO2 improved to 94%–95%. Vital signs and ventilation parameters during surgery are shown in . Anesthesia was maintained with sufentanil 20 μg/h and sevoflurane 2%–2.5% (concentration of sevoflurane was adjusted according to the patient’s increased age), and rocuronium was given intermittently.\nAfter median sternotomy, 400 U/kg heparin was administered. Arterial cannulation was performed via ascending aorta. Venous cannulation was inserted via the right atrial appendage into the superior and inferior vena cava. After CPB was established, oxygenation of the patient improved significantly with the SpO2 improved to 99%–100%. The patient was kept anesthetized with midazolam 0.1 mg/kg/h, sufentanil 0.15 μg/kg/h, and rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg/h intravenously under hypothermic CPB, and nasopharyngeal and rectal temperature were maintained at 25°C and 28°C, respectively. Activated clotting time (ACT) was performed intermittently, and the results are shown in .\nUnder direct view, the mass was large and occupied nearly the entire left atrium. The right atrium and atrial septum were incised, and the mass was found attached by a stalk to the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein. The mass in the left atrium was totally resected, and was 15×2 cm. The tumor in the left superior pulmonary vein could not be completely resected, and palliative resection of the tumor around the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein was performed to ease tumor-related symptoms. As a result, preload was improved while pulmonary hypertension remained a problem. After rewarming and deairing of the heart, the aortic cross-clamp was removed. The heart came back into sinus rhythm with 20J intracardiac defibrillation, and then, the CPB was discontinued gradually. Weaning was facilitated with norepinephrine 0.05 μg/kg/min and dopamine 5 μg/kg/min to achieve goal mean arterial BP.65 mmHg. Nitroglycerin 0.5–0.8 μg/kg/min was used to decrease systemic vascular resistance. A total of 800 mL of packed red blood cells were gradually infused to increase preload. Vital signs showed an ABP of 110/70 mmHg, an HR of 110 bpm, a CVP of 12 cmH2O, and an SpO2 of 93%–95%. Heparin was neutralized with protamine (1 mg/100 U heparin). The total CPB time was 100 min, and the aortic occlusion time was 85 min. The overall fluid balance during CPB was −2,700 mL. The estimated blood loss was 800 mL. Arterial blood gas analysis after CPB discontinuation is also showed in .\nAfter CPB, the partial pressure of oxygen in artery (PaO2) was 68 mmHg with FiO2 100% and PEEP 6 cmH2O and was increased from that before tumor resection (48 mmHg). After excluding bronchospasm and acute lung injury, we assumed that this was due to unrelieved cardiogenic pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension, as well as residual tumor in the pulmonary vessels. Inotropic agents including epinephrine 0.05 μg/kg/min, dopamine 5 μg/kg/min, and nitroglycerin 0.5–0.8 μg/kg/min were continuously used to improve cardiac output and facilitate stable hemodynamics, so as to alleviate pulmonary edema. Hyperventilation was applied to decrease PaCO2 and prevent acidosis. Hypoxia pulmonary vasoconstriction may have been partially inhibited, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure was decreased from 67 to <35 mmHg (postoperative TTE). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with BP 110/71 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, and SpO2 95% during admission. Oxygenation was improved compared to the level before left atrial tumor resection (91 vs 48 mmHg), and HR was decreased (103 vs 111 bpm), indicating that pulmonary edema was partially relieved. Increasing FiO2, decreasing O2 consumption, and optimizing acid–base balance and hemoglobin, together with protective ventilation, were provided and resulted in oxygenation improvement. Vasoactive medications and mechanical ventilation were gradually weaned, and vital signs remained stable. Chest X-ray performed 3 h postoperatively revealed significantly relieved pulmonary edema (). The patient was extubated on postoperative day 4 while he was conscious, and the vital signs showed BP 121/72 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, and SpO2 95%–97% with FiO2 85%. He was discharged 10 days after the surgery with symptoms ameliorated and SpO2 97% with FiO2 21%. Histopathological examination of the resected lesion revealed features consistent with leiomyosarcoma. Further management of the lung metastasis of leiomyosarcoma and possible radiation therapy are needed. Some authors suggest that multimodal therapy (surgical resection, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy) may result in reasonable survival improvement for patients. Isambert et al reported a mean survival of 18.2 months after incomplete resection and 11.2 months in nonresected patients. In our case, the patient received palliative treatment after surgery and died of tumor-related cardiopulmonary failure 6 months later. The timeline of history, interventions, and outcomes are summarized in .\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient’s next of kin for publication of this case report.\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

The patient was a smoker, had a history of hypertension, and was taking captopril and nimodipine. Breathing was reduced in the left lung. However, neither rhonchus nor moist rales were heard during auscultation. Chest computed tomography revealed a GEB, and the left lung was compressed by about 95% with a right mediastinal shift (). An electrocardiogram showed normal findings, and echocardiography revealed that the heart was located in the right thoracic cavity. The left ventricular diastolic function was decreased, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 64%. Laboratory tests showed no obvious abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis showed the following: pH: 7.43, PaCO2: 41 mmHg, PaO2: 94 mmHg, lactate: 1.4 mmol/L, potassium: 3.6 mmol/L, sodium: 138 mmol/L, calcium: 1.10 mmol/L, FiO2: 21%, and SpO2: 98%.\nOn the day of surgery, the patient’s electrocardiogram, blood pressure, SpO2, and bispectral index were monitored upon entry into the operating room. A radial artery catheter and right internal jugular venous catheter were placed. The patient’s arterial blood pressure was 175/109 mmHg, heart rate was 90 beats/minute, and SpO2 was 94%. Before anesthesia, 40 µg of dexmedetomidine was infused within 10 minutes. The thoracic surgeon then created a small incision at the intersection of the sixth intercostal space and the left mid-axillary line to puncture the lung bulla and insert an indwelling catheter (14 Ga, 16 cm in length; Arrow International/Teleflex, Wayne, PA, USA) into the GEB to drain it for 15 minutes. The patient was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen at 6 L/minute for 5 minutes. Anesthesia was administered using 100 mg of propofol, 30 µg of sufentanil, and 50 mg of rocuronium. A 37-Fr right double-lumen endotracheal tube was inserted with the help of a visual laryngoscope, and single-lung ventilation was performed after proper alignment had been confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The tidal volume was set at 5 to 6 mL/kg, the respiratory rate was 15 to 17 breaths/minute, the positive end-expiratory pressure was set at 5 cmH2O, and the inhalation:expiration ratio was 1:2. Propofol, remifentanil, and sevoflurane were used to maintain anesthesia. The intraoperative bispectral index was maintained at 40 to 50. After resecting the GEB (), one-lung ventilation was switched to two-lung ventilation and the lungs slowly expanded with a low tidal volume until complete lung re-expansion was observed. During the 3-hour surgery, the patient experienced 50 mL of blood loss, was administered 1300 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution, and excreted 500 mL of urine. After the operation, the double-lumen endotracheal tube was replaced with a single-lumen endotracheal tube and the patient was sent to the intensive care unit for monitoring and further treatment. Two hours after entering the intensive care unit, the patient was fully awake and the tracheal tube was smoothly removed. The following day, the patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery ward, where he recovered; he was discharged 12 days later.

He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.\nAcidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.\nOur patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.\n\nWhat is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?\n\nSodium Correction for Hyperglycemia: correction = Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100)",

            "input": "A 25-year-old male (height 167.7 cm, weight 52.2 kg) was admitted for surgical resection of a 5.0 × 1.8 cm right-cheek mass, suspected to be a lymphangioma. The patient had undergone a tonsillectomy under general anesthesia 8 years previously without any perioperative complication. The medical history indicated no drug or food allergies. Preoperative examinations of the patient were within normal limits. Therefore, anesthesia was applied according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification 1.\nThe patient received no premedication prior to admission to the operating theater. The blood pressure upon arrival in the operating theater was 158/76 mmHg, with a heart rate of 80 beats/min (BPM), and with a peripheral oxygen saturation of 99% of room air. Anesthesia was induced using an injection of 50 µg fentanyl, 150 mg propofol and 50 mg rocuronium. Endotracheal intubation was performed using a cuffed oral right-angle endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained using oxygen, air and desflurane. As a prophylactic antibiotic, 1 g cefazoline was administered intravenously immediately after completion of induction.\nOne hour after commencing surgery, the surgeon requested a reversal of the neuromuscular blockade to monitor patency of the facial nerve. Anesthesia was consequently maintained using desflurane alone. At this time, the blood pressure was 105/74 mmHg and the heart rate 92 BPM. We administered 1 mg atropine and 1.5 mg neostigmine intravenously to reverse neuromuscular blockade. After approximately 5 min, the blood pressure was decreased to 75/42 mmHg and the heart rate was 104 BPM. We administered 10 mg ephedrine intravenously. After 5 min, the blood pressure was 67/36 mmHg and the heart rate was 94 BPM. To manage persistent hypotension, 200 µg phenylephrine were administered, followed by a rapid infusion of lactated Ringer's solution. However, the non-invasive blood pressure decreased further to 57/36 mmHg and the heart rate rose to 138 BPM. As we asked the surgeon, there was no drug administration at surgical field.\nInvasive blood pressure monitoring was applied to the left dorsalis pedis artery and additional venous access was established. The arterial blood gas analysis showed all parameters to be within normal limits. Continuous infusion of norepinephrine at 0.03 µg/kg/min was initiated. Consequently, the blood pressure was restored to 99/51 mmHg and surgery was resumed.\nBecause the patient was covered with a drape, clinical manifestation of anaphylaxis, including skin rash, could not be observed. Approximately 1 h after the hypotension event, a skin rash was detected over the entire body. There were no respiratory symptoms, including wheezing or increased airway pressure. The patient was suspected to be suffering from an anaphylactic reaction. A 10 µg bolus of epinephrine was given and a continuous epinephrine infusion was initiated at 0.03 µg/kg/min. The patient responded to the epinephrine and soon maintained hemodynamic stability; with a blood pressure of 110/52 mmHg and a heart rate of 78 BPM. Norepinephrine infusion was discontinued and epinephrine infusion was tapered to maintain the restored blood pressure. The patient was treated using 4 mg chlorpheniramine together with 5 mg dexamethasone to prevent delayed reactions and halt any further histamine release. After 1.5 h, the blood pressure was 110/46 mmHg without any inotropic or vasopressor support. The skin lesion was improved and no respiratory symptoms were detected throughout the completion of the surgery. The total operation time was 200 min and the anesthesia time 245 min. The total infused crystalloid, colloid, estimated blood loss and urine output were 1,300 ml, 500 ml, 50 ml, and 450 ml, respectively ().\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and was placed on ventilatory support. An hour after arrival, the patient was extubated uneventfully without any neurologic deficit. Blood tests were obtained for the tryptase level, which was elevated to 37.9 µg/L (normal range: 0-11 µg/L) and the total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, which was increased to 675 Ku/L (normal range: negative). The patient was transferred to a general ward 1 day later and was discharged after 1 week without any complications. The consultant allergist recommended that allergen tests be conducted.\nSkin-prick and intradermal tests were performed after 1 month to determine the cause of the anaphylaxis. The skinprick tests were negative for all agents, whereas the intradermal tests were positive for atropine (wheal of 4 × 4 mm for a stock concentration of 0.5 mg/ml; wheal of 4 × 4 mm with 1 : 5 dilution) (). The intradermal skin tests also demonstrated a positive result for rocuronium (wheal of 5 × 5 mm for a stock concentration of 10 mg/ml; wheal of 4 × 4 mm with 1 : 10 dilution). The patient was advised to completely avoid atropine and is currently receiving regular check-ups at the outpatient department of plastic surgery.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?\n\nMaintenance Fluids Calculations: maintenance_fluid = base_value + weight_coefficient * weight, where base_value is 60 ml/hr for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 40 ml/hr for patients with a weight between 10kg and 20kg, and 0 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg, and weight_coefficient is 1 for patients with a weight of greater than 20kg, 2 for patients  with a weight between between 10kg and 20kg, and 4 for patients with a weight of less than 10kg",

She was diagnosed as Basedow’s disease at 39 years old and after then she started taking 30 mg of thiamazole (MMI). In physical examination, she had no remarkable symptom such as palpitation, general fatigue and insomnia and did not have a goiter. Her height and body weight were 158.0 cm and 63.6 kg. Her vital signs were: heart rate 112 beats/min, blood pressure 132/86 mmHg. Laboratory data were as follows: white blood cell count, 4580 /μL (neutrophil 57.7%); red blood cell count, 476 × 104 /μL; hemoglobin, 12.7 g/dL; platelet, 26.5 × 104 /μL; Na, 142 mmol/L; K, 5.2 mmol/L. Renal and liver function was within normal range (creatinine (CRE), 0.38 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), asparate aminotransferase (AST), 25 U/L; alanine transaminase (ALT), 26 U/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 231 U/L; γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (γ-GTP), 17 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 174 U/L). Thyroid-associated data were as follows: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), < 0.010 μIU/mL; free triiodothyronine (FT3), 19.05 pg/mL; free thyroxine (FT4) 4.88 ng/dL; TRAb, 10.6 IU/L (electro chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), SRL Inc., Tokyo); TPOAb, 216.9 IU/mL (ECLIA, SRL Inc., Tokyo); TgAb antibody, 428.9 IU/mL (ECLIA, SRL Inc., Tokyo). Ultrasound examination revealed that the thyroid gland was hypervascular although it was not enlarged (Fig. ). Based on such findings, we finally diagnosed her as Basedow’s disease. Two weeks after starting MMI therapy, she had liver dysfunction (AST, 420 U/L; ALT, 368 U/L; ALP, 565 U/L; γ-GTP, 178 U/L; LDH, 337 U/L), and we changed the treatment of MMI to 300 mg of propylthiouracil (PTU) although her thyroid hormone levels were decreased (TSH, < 0.010 μIU/mL; FT3, 7.2 4 pg/mL; F T4 1.97 ng/dL). After then, her liver function was improved, and we tapered PTU. About 2 years later, her thyroid hormone levels were within normal range with 50 mg of PTU every other day, and her TRAb became negative. After then, we stopped PTU therapy.\nAbout 1.5 years later, she had low grade fever and palpitation and visited our office again. Her body weight was 70.9 kg. Her vital signs were: heart rate 116 beats/min, blood pressure 140/98 mmHg. Laboratory data were as follows: white blood cell count, 3710 /μL (neutrophil 58.3%); red blood cell count, 535 × 104 /μL; hemoglobin, 12.2 g/dL; platelet, 22.4 × 104 /μL; Na, 142 mmol/L; K, 4.2 mmol/L. Renal and liver function was within normal range (CRE, 0.52 mg/dL; BUN 9 mg/dL; AST, 25 U/L; ALT, 17 U/L; ALP, 218 U/L; γ-GTP, 19 U/L; LDH, 206 U/L). Thyroid-associated data were as follows: TSH, < 0.010 μIU/mL; FT3, 5.22 pg/mL; FT4, 1.85 ng/dL; TRAb, 4.6 IU/L; TPOAb, 147.4 IU/mL; TgAb, 591.2 IU/mL. Ultrasound examination revealed that the thyroid gland was not hypervascular compared to that at the onset of Basedow’s disease (Fig. ). Based on such findings, we finally diagnosed her as the relapse of Basedow’s disease. We started again 300 mg of PTU and tapered PTU dose. About 4 months later, her thyroid hormone levels became within normal range by taking 50 mg of PTU every other day. During the PTU therapy, her WBC levels were slightly lower and CRP levels were slightly higher, although she had no symptom in the whole body including in skin. We checked various autoimmune antibodies. Anti-double stranded DNA IgG antibody, anti-SS-A/Ro antibody and anti-SS-B/La antibody were all negative. However, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), myeloperoxidase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) and proteinase3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) were all positive (ANA, 37.8 (+); MPO-ANCA, 35.0 U/mL; PR3-ANCA, 36.9 U/mL).\nWe performed a total thyroidectomy. Table shows laboratory data before a total thyroidectomy in this subject taking 50 mg of PTU every other day. In general, the thyroid gland in subjects with Basedow’s disease shows diffuse goiter due to chronic stimulation. However, her thyroid was flat and atrophic although diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid gland was observed in histopathological macroscopic findings (Fig. ). Furthermore, hyperplasia of the thyroid gland was shown in part and hyperplastic thyroid follicles with papillary infoldings was observed in histopathological microscopic examination. Tall follicular cells with papillae usually lacked fibrovascular cores and peripheral scalloping was present (Fig. ). On the other hand, a part of the thyroid area showed a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, accompanied by follicles containing germinal centers. In addition, a destroyed pattern of lymphoid follicle was observed (Fig. ).\nOne year later, thyroid-associated autoimmune antibodies were all decreased (TRAb, 2.2 IU/L; TSAb, 130% (enzyme immunoassay, SRL Inc., Tokyo); TPOAb, 98. 3 IU/mL; TgAb, 151.0 IU/mL), and 2 years later thyroid-associated autoimmune antibodies were further improved (TRAb, 1.1 IU/L; TSAb, 90%; TPOAb, 24.0 IU/mL; TgAb, 12.8 IU/mL). White blood cell count became within normal range (about 5000–7000 /μL (neutrophil 58–68%) and CRP level became almost normal (0.15–0.20 mg/dL).\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

He had been diagnosed with CD 10 years previously, but he was lost to follow-up, during which he experienced repeated exacerbations and remissions. The patient had taken mesalazine 3,000 mg/day and azathioprine 50 mg/day and had started infliximab one year prior to admission. With infliximab, the patient experienced immediate relief of diarrhea and abdominal pain, but obstructive symptoms had gradually worsened. He complained of abdominal pain, increased borborygmus, decreased oral intake, and a decrease in body weight. Abdominal CT scan and small bowel series revealed an ileocolic fistula, multiple ulcers, and severe stricture of the small bowel (). Vital signs (blood pressure, 120/80 mmHg; pulse rate, 80 beats/min; respiratory rate, 20 beats/min; body temperature, 36.9℃) were normal. He has a height of 171 cm, a weight of 53 kg, and a BMI of 18.1 kg/m2. The patient had a chronically ill appearance with pale conjunctiva, mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, and accentuated bowel sounds. Liver and spleen were not palpable. Pitting edema could be seen on both lower limbs. Laboratory testing revealed anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 3,970/mm3, and platelet count of 265,000/mm3. Serum chemistry tests were consistent with severe malnutrition: AST/ALT 53/29 IU/L, BUN/creatinine 15/0.64 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 4.3/2.2 g/dL, and total cholesterol 88 mg/dL. ESR and CRP level were 35 mm/h and 2.1 mg/dL, respectively. Both anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae-antibodies IgA and IgG were negative, and the patient's CDAI was about 261 points. He had been experiencing approximately 25 liquid stools per week, severe abdominal pain, and a very poor sense of well-being. To improve the patient's condition, wide resection of involved bowel and colostomy would be needed; however, because of a psychological reaction to personal disfigurement and the need to relearn bowel habits, he strongly refused colostomy. Therefore, we decided to perform a small and large bowel segmental resection and primary repair.\nGross findings during surgery included an abscess connected to the terminal ileum, bladder adhesion, a jejuno-sigmoid fistula, and huge inflammatory masses. An ileocecectomy, jejunal resection, and sigmoid colon resection were performed, followed by primary repair of the jejunum, rectum, and sigmoid colon (). Fortunately, 220 cm of the small bowel remained after surgery. However, one week postoperatively, the patient developed a high fever and abdominal pain. Abdominal CT scan revealed a fistula connected to an intraperitoneal abscess (). The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics, and the abscess was drained percutaneously. A total of four percutaneous drainages were performed. The drainage fluid was dark yellow and highly viscous but gradually cleared after continuous use of antibiotics. However, despite no further evidence of infection (white blood cell count 4,270/mm3 and CRP 0.3 mg/dL), approximately 30-50 cc of fluid issued from every drain daily, even one month after the operation.\nThe patient was started on 5 mg/kg of infliximab to treat the postoperative fistula and prevent a recurrence. After infliximab therapy was initiated, drainage decreased dramatically to less than 10 cc a day. In follow-up abdominal CT scans, the abscess in the abdominal cavity and the postoperative fistula disappeared (). The percutaneous drainages were consecutively removed, the patient began receiving oral nutrition, and the intravenous antibiotics were stopped. The patient quit smoking, and infliximab was injected to prevent disease recurrence. Three months after surgery, the patient looked healthy and reported passing stools once or twice a day. His body weight increased by 8 kg, BMI increased to 20.9 kg/m2, and his CDAI decreased to 60. In follow-up laboratory exams, the patient's hemoglobin level was 12.7 g/dL, total protein and albumin were 6.9/3.9 g/dL, and total cholesterol was 130 mg/dL.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?\n\nAdjusted Body Weight: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg))",

She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years ago for ischaemic heart disease. Blood investigation showed haemoglobin 9.2 gm/dl, normal blood count, renal function and serum electrolytes. Serum calcium was 8.3 mg/dl and serum albumin was 3.2 mg/dl. Glycosylated haemoglobin was 6.0, revealing adequate blood glucose control. Electrocardiogram showed evidence of old inferior wall myocardial infarction. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function with mild hypertrophy. She was on tablet aspirin 75 mg once daily (OD) orally for antithrombotic prophylaxis.\nIn view of her cardiac history, adequate perioperative analgesia was needed along with general anaesthesia. Thus, right sided continuous erector spinae block along was planned in combination with general anaesthesia.\nPreoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was administered with injection cefuroxime 1.5 g intravenous (IV). Under ultrasound guidance, a continuous erector spinae block was performed at L3 level. After explaining the procedure, consent was taken from the patient. She was placed in left lateral position for right sided block since we found it ergonomically easy to hold the ultrasound probe (high frequency linear probe) with left hand and place it transversely. An 18-guage tuohy needle was approached in-plane lateral to medial. When the needle initially touched the transverse process of L3 vertebrae, the needle was gently withdrawn and hydrodissection of the plane was achieved, lifting the erector spinae muscle. A 20-guage catheter was introduced through the needle and total length inserted was 3 cm more than the tip of needle. The catheter was secured properly for perioperative use. The patient was hydrated with 10 ml/kg of ringer lactate before induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with injection fentanyl 75 mcg iv and injection propofol 100 mg iv and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) size 3 was inserted. Anaesthesia was maintained with FiO20.5 (nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture) and sevoflurane. A bolus dose of 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine was given through the catheter placed in erector spinae plane. The procedure was uneventful with no haemodynamic disturbances and minimal blood loss. After surgery, inhalational anaesthetics were stopped, and LMA was removed. Patient had an uneventful recovery. Post-operatively, the patient was comfortable with infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine at 6 ml/h as continuous erector spinae block. She did not require any rescue analgesics.

She also presented body weight loss (2 kg per 3 months) and flatulence, but no abdominal pain. The patient was admitted to the hospital in a poor condition with dehydration symptoms, her abdomen was distended, no peristalsis, but also no mass palpable was observed during the physical examination. On admission to the hospital, the child was feverish (38.5˚C). Serum electrolyte concentration indicated hyponatremia and severe hypokalemia (sodium 129 mmol/l, potassium 1,6 mmol/l). An intravenous potassium solution was used. It was required about 60 mmol of potassium per day to obtain a potassium serum concentration of 3 mmol/l. Because of the massive watery diarrhea and so severe hypokalemia, a VIP-secreting tumor was suspected. The computerized tomography scan (CT) showed a heterogeneous tumor (45 × 45 × 65 mm) with calcifications localized in retroperitoneal right space in front of the aitchbone. In 24-hour urine test, the increase of dopamine (356 µg) and normal value of vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) (1.9 mg) were observed. Serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and VIP concentration were above the upper limit of normal (31.61 ng/ml and 222 pmol/l respectively). The ferritin value (53.89 ng/ml) was in the normal range. A bone marrow examination as well as skeletal scintigraphy and metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) scintigraphy did not detect any metastases. The patient underwent surgery, removing the tumor (65 × 43 × 42 mm) and local lymph nodes. The pathology examination revealed an atypical ganglioneuroblastoma (). The first molecular test showed a positive amplification of MYCN and chemotherapy was applied – carboplatin/etoposide, and subsequently cyclophosphamide, vincristine and doxorubicin (CADO).

Physical examination and initial vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.0℃; pulse rate, 66 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and blood pressure, 140/90 mmHg. Her height and body weight were 158 cm and 66 kg. She had a 10-year history of hypertension with good blood pressure control from oral Valsartan (40 mg/day). Her familial history was unremarkable. Laboratory examinations showed a low white blood cell count of 3,920/µL, a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/L, and a platelet count of 124,000/µL. The liver function test results were as follows: serum aspartate transaminase: 14 U/L; alanine transaminase: 19 U/L; alkaline phosphatase: 88 IU/L; gamma-glutamyl transferase: 16 U/L; total bilirubin: 4.05 µmol/L; albumin, 35.7 g/L; and international normalized ratio: 0.93. CA 19-9 and α-FP were assayed for a malignancy workup, with results of 16.35 U/mL and 2.61 ng/mL, respectively. The results for viral markers including HBV surface antigen and anti-HCV were negative. Abdominal CT revealed an atrophic left lobar and dilated bile duct with the middle hepatic vein close to the cystic lesion (). Abdominal MRCP revealed irregular intrahepatic bile duct dilatation (IHBDD) of the left lobe with the left hepatic duct obstructed, while the common bile duct and right intrahepatic bile duct were normal (). However, we found that the irregular cystic dilatation of the bile duct was limited to the left liver and contained stones inside the cysts. No obvious abnormal dilated bile duct was found in the right liver. The common bile duct and the hepatic duct were normal, and no obvious dilatation was found. This patient was diagnosed with Caroli disease (type V). The surgical indication for the patient was explicit. However, the treatment prescription required consideration of the cystic wall being adjacent to the middle hepatic vein, the left hepatic atrophy and structure disorder, and the observation that the left hepatic vein was not visible. Although complete resection of the cysts may be a curative treatment for unilobar Caroli disease, this treatment was impossible for this patient due to the close adherence of the middle hepatic vein to the cystic wall. Therefore, we decided to perform laparoscopic left LR for the patient, while preserving a partial cystic wall close to the middle hepatic vein.\nThe standard laparoscopic equipment used to perform laparoscopic hepatectomy included a 30° 5-mm laparoscope, a hook dissector, 5-mm laparoscopic forceps, a 5-mm atraumatic grasper, a 10-mm GIA (Johnson & Johnson Medical, Shanghai, China), 5-mm harmonic (Johnson & Johnson Medical) and 10-mm locking pliers.\nThe conventional fully laparoscopic multiport approach was adopted. The patient was placed in a supine position, and the surgeon stood on the right side. Under general anesthesia, five 5- to 10-mm incisions were made in a “U” configuration. Division of the liver parenchyma was performed with Harmonic or Endo-GIA. Large pedicles were stapled or clipped.\nUpon surgical exploration, the left lobe of the liver was found to be atrophied, and the right liver had developed compensatory hyperplasia with a red-brown and smooth surface. However, the left liver lobe was severely adherent. We gradually dissected the adhesion using harmonic pliers and exposed the atrophic left lobe (5 cm × 6 cm × 2 cm). The gallbladder was approximately 7 cm × 4 cm × 2 cm in size and was filled with bile and gallstones. Through intraoperative exploration, we confirmed the diagnosis of Caroli disease, limited to the left lobe of the liver. We obtained a biopsy from the edge of the lesion and performed a rapid intraoperative pathological examination to exclude malignant tumor. We then decided to perform a laparoscopic left liver and gallbladder resection. The difficulty was that the lesion was close to the middle hepatic vein. We opened the cysts and resected most of the lesion while retaining part of cystic wall close to the middle hepatic vein. After laparoscopic left half-liver and gallbladder resection, the liver lesion tissue and gallbladder were removed completely from the abdominal cavity. Histopathologic findings showed congenital dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, confirming the preoperative diagnosis of Caroli disease (). Histopathology of the resected specimen revealed large, cystic dilations of the large intrahepatic bile ducts. This patient was seen regularly every 3 months at the outpatient department. There was no recurrence of abdominal pain, and no complications were discovered after 18 months of follow-up.\n\nWhat is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?\n\nFibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT)",

He had a history for appendectomy at the age of 42 and sarcoidosis and RA at the age of 62. He had been treated with MTX at weekly dose of 8–14 mg for 2 years and infliximab (IFX) at 3–6 mg/kg for 7 months for RA. Although there has been no significant history of liver dysfunction before MTX therapy, persistent elevation of liver enzymes has been observed during MTX treatment; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 36 to 128 U/L (normal value: 13–33) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 44 to 93 U/L (normal value: 8–42). Physical examination at the time of admission revealed neither enlarged superficial lymph nodes nor jaundice. The laboratory findings on admission were: white blood cell count 4.3X109/L, hemoglobin 11.1 g/dl, platelet count 147X109/L, AST 92 U/L, ALT 33 U/L, total bilirubin 1.1 mg/dl (normal value: 0.3-1.9), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 401 U/L (normal range 115–359) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1,114 U/ml (normal range 119–229). No lymphoma cells were detected in his peripheral blood. A high LDH/AST ratio (12.1) was observed. Soluble IL-2 receptor was 3,465 U/ml (normal range 254–534). Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was within normal range, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was slightly elevated (16.3 ng/ml, normal value 10 ng/ml≧). Serological tests for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-cell leukemia virus I (HTLV-I) and human immune deficiency virus (HIV) were all negative.\nContrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen (Figure A and B) revealed multiple irregular and nodular liver masses with a maximum of 13 cm in diameter on the right liver. CECT scan of the brain, neck, chest and pelvis showed no enlarged lymph nodes or masses. Multiple hypoechoic bulky liver masses were observed in ultrasound examination. There was no significant bone marrow infiltration of lymphoma cells.\nDiagnosis of PHL was made by using percutaneous tumor biopsy of the liver, which had diffuse infiltration of medium to large lymphoid cells with remarkable nucleoi. The tumor cells were positive for CD20 (Figure B), CD79a (Figure C) and CD10 (Figure D), and negative for bcl-2 (Figure E), CD3 (Figure F), and EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBER) by in situ hybridization (ISH) (Figure G). The findings were consistent with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and according to the WHO 2008 classification of lymphoid tissue, he was diagnosed as other iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated LPDs.\nRA treatment including MTX was discontinued. He became asymptomatic, and serum LDH returned to normal levels. His liver function also improved. Oral prednisolone (PSL) was administered at the initial dose of 60 mg/day (0.7 mg/kg) for two weeks and was reduced to 10 mg/day every three days. Three months after discontinuation of RA treatment, the tumor masses dramatically regressed (Figure ). However, since a small liver mass was still observed, the patient was further treated with a total of 8 cycles of R-CHOP: Rituximab (375 mg/m2) with cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2), vincristine (1.4 mg/m2), doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) and prednisolone (60 mg/m2).

The pain was: retrosternal; of sudden onset, starting 2 hours prior to presentation at our hospital; continuous and worsening in severity; described as pressure; irradiating to the neck and left upper extremity; had no precipitating or alleviating factors; and was associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. She denied headache, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, or vomiting. Prior to the pain beginning, the patient denied having any of the symptoms. Review of her system was negative except for the symptoms mentioned.\nThe patient had no significant medical history except that she was seen many years prior for mild thrombocytosis during her pregnancy. At that time, she was started on aspirin. She did not keep her follow-up appointments afterward. Her surgical history was significant for hysterectomy.\nHer father had had coronary artery disease and MI at the age of 50; he died at the age of 67. Her mother had been diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia and succumbed to blastic crisis after 7 years. Three of the patient’s four children were positive for Factor V Leiden and one daughter developed extensive deep-vein thrombosis after 4 weeks on the oral contraceptive pills and major bleeding on warfarin (severe hemorrhagic ovarian cysts).\nThe patient was a nonsmoker and denied any alcohol or drug use. She had no history of allergy. Her only medication was baby aspirin once daily.\nOn initial examination, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented. Her blood pressure was 90/60 μg, and she had a pulse of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 99°F. There was no jugular vein distention. Auscultation was clear throughout both lungs. Cardiac auscultation revealed an S4 gallop. No loud murmurs were appreciated. Abdominal exam was unremarkable, with no hepatosplenomegaly. There was no edema of the lower extremities. There was positive erythromelalgia of the hands.\nHer electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads from V1 to V6 consistent with a large anterior wall infarct ().\nInitial blood work showed negative cardiac enzymes. Her hemoglobin was 13.7 g/dL, white blood cell count was 14.2 th/mm3, and platelet count was 935,000 th/mm3. The patient’s basic metabolic profile was normal. Her low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein were 148 mg/dL and 61 mg/dL, respectively.\nThe patient was transferred urgently to the catheterization lab. Left heart catheterization showed a total proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion (), while her other coronary arteries were normal. A successful balloon angioplasty, with two bare metal stents, was performed on the 100% lesion in the proximal LAD, and an excellent result was attained (). The patient was started, in addition to aspirin (325 mg daily), on clopidogrel, a statin, and beta-blockers. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% with severe hypokinesia of the mid-apical anteroseptal and apical walls.\nDuring her hospital stay, the patient was seen by the hematology-oncology team. Further workup was done and this showed a positive JAK-2 mutation. She was negative for the Factor V Leiden mutation (R506Q) and BCR-ABL genes translocation (Philadelphia chromosome). The rest of her blood work was within normal limits, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (1 mm/h), ferritin (151 ng/mL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (1.3 mIU/mL), folate (10.2 ng/mL), vitamin B12 (382 pg/mL) and bleeding time (1.1 min). Patient was diagnosed with ET and started on hydroxyurea 1,000 mg twice daily. Patient was discharged in a stable condition with the plan to follow up with the cardiologist and hematologist.\nTwo weeks later, during a follow-up at the hematology office, her complete blood count revealed a platelet count of 803 th/mm3, so the dose of hydroxyurea was increased to 2,500 mg twice daily. Subsequent follow-up a few weeks later indicated a platelet count of 310 th/mm3, so the patient was kept on the same dose for the next 3 years. Her platelet count four months ago was still within the normal range.\nThe patient has been followed-up in the outpatient cardiology office for the last 3 years. Within a few months, her left ventricular function was found to have improved to normal and has been normal since then. We managed her as a coronary artery disease (CAD) equivalent, continued on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) beyond 1 year.\n\nWhat is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?\n\nFramingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease: For men, risk_score = 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not, and if age is greater than 70, the age variable is set to 70 within the 'age' term for the β x ln(Age) x Smoker term.

The patient experienced good relief of lower limb pain with stimulation.\nAt the point of insertion, she weighed 78.8 kg, with a height of 157 cm (body mass index [BMI], 31.9). Her pre-PMP assessment revealed moderate levels of depression and high levels of pain-related disability. Her Beck Depression Inventory score was 18 (mild). She had a Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale of 60 (mean, 94; SD, 39; range 0–200, where 0 = no pain anxiety and 200 = severe pain anxiety).\nIn October 2011, she underwent reprogramming with failure to achieve satisfactory stimulation. Her imaging revealed twisting of the connecting wires adjacent to the pulse generator (Fig. ). As it was still partially functioning, she chose to defer revision surgery. Eventually the device failed completely. In May 2012, her IPG was repositioned with new connector leads. The connector wires were found knotted and twisted intraoperatively.

He also had long-standing diabetes, hypertension and was on multiple medications such as regular insulin, aspirin 75 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, metoprolol 25 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg daily and nitrocontin 2.6 mg twice daily.\nOn examination, he was obese with poor effort tolerance. There was no pallor or edema feet and no signs of heart failure. His resting heart rate (HR) was 70/min and blood pressure measured 130/80 mmHg.\nMost of his preoperative blood investigations including coagulation profile were within normal limits except random blood sugar which was 164 mg/dl. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed Q waves in leads II, III and aVF and ST segment depression in leads V1 -V6. The preoperative chest X-ray was normal. Two-dimensional echo done on admission revealed akinetic inferior and mid-posterior wall; hypokinetic basal, posterior wall, mid and distal interventricular septum; mildly dilated LV and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <25%.\nTwo months ago, a detailed cardiac work up of the patient had been done wherein a coronary angiogram revealed anomalous origin of the LAD from RCA and absent left main coronary artery (). Thallium scan also showed LVEF of 25% at rest tomography angiography showed a common ostium for RCA and LAD ().\nChronic total occlusion of RCA (after giving off LAD) as well as a short, narrowed out left circumflex (LCx) artery resulted in complete loss of viable myocardium in their corresponding territories. Thus, the myocardium had its blood supply from LAD and partly from LCx artery.\nThe patient was on medical management as coronary revascularization could not be considered owing to the semi-emergent nature of surgery and that most of the myocardium was already compromised. The patient's relatives were initially reluctant to give their consent for the procedure, thereby causing delay in surgical intervention. Until then, the patient was managed conservatively on continuous Ryle's tube aspiration, intravenous fluids and antibiotics.\nAll the prescribed medications were continued preoperatively except aspirin and clopidogrel, which were stopped at admission. Low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 60 mg subcutaneously twice daily) was started. It was discontinued 24 hours prior to surgery. The patient was hemodynamically stable and co-operative. Therefore, sequential epidural combined with local infiltration of the surgical site with 0.25% bupivacaine was selected as the anesthetic technique. Central venous pressure (CVP), arterial blood pressure (ABP), blood gas analysis and continuous cardiac output (CO) monitoring (Edwards Life sciences FloTrac monitor) were used along with routine monitors. The baseline ABP, HR, CVP, CO were 122/72 mmHg, 90/min, 7 mmHg and 7 L/min respectively. An epidural catheter was inserted in T10 -T11 interspace with the patient in sitting position. This provided sufficient analgesia and motor blockade for surgery. The surgical site was also infiltrated with 10 ml of 2% lignocaine. The patient was on spontaneous ventilation with tittrated mild sedation with fentanyl and midazolam. Total fluid administered was 1.5 L (1 L of normal saline; 500 ml of colloid). It was guided by CVP, stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV) and CO on the Edwards Sciences FloTrac Vigileo monitor. The patient remained hemodynamically stable until about 50 min of the start of surgery when ABP was 86/54 (65mmHg) and CO was 3 L/min probably due to last epidural bolus of bupivacaine. This was not accompanied by any ECG changes. CVP remained normal. Blood loss was minimal. Ionotropic support (nor-adrenaline 0.07 μg/kg/min) was then started. Thereafter, ABP stabilized and serial ABG's done during surgery were normal. The surgical procedure included resection of gangrenous segment of bowel, anastomosis and anatomical repair of hernia, which lasted approximately 2 h.\nPostoperatively, 12 lead ECG was done, which showed no fresh changes. Trop-T done after 12 h of surgery was also negative. Intensive monitoring (ABP, CVP, ECG, and CO) was continued for 48 h postoperatively. The ionotropic support was tapered and discontinued after 36 h of surgery to maintain a mean ABP of 75-80 mm Hg. Analgesia was maintained with epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine with100 mcg fentanyl in 50 ml of normal saline titrated to effect and hemodynamics, intravenous analgesics (diclofenac 75 mg 8 hourly and tramadol whenever required). All preoperative medications including enoxaparin (60 mg sc twice daily for 2 days) and Aspirin were restarted on the 1st postoperative day (POD) and review done by a cardiologist and an endocrinologist. Epidural catheter was removed on the 2nd POD after which clopidogrel was resumed. The course of stay in the surgical intensive care unit (48 h) and later in the ward was uneventful.

She was well until two days before admission when she developed generalized tonic clonic seizure. At a local clinic, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia and azotemia were detected and she was referred to us. On admission, generalized edema was noted. Her external genitalia were normal female. Laboratory findings showed: hemoglobin, 9.8 g/dL; cholesterol, 120 mg/dL; total serum protein, 3.7 g/dL; serum albumin, 1.5 g/dL; BUN, 75 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 4.1 mg/dL; total calcium, 5.9 mg/dL; phosphorus, 12.7 mg/dL; sodium, 136 mEq/L; potassium, 5.5 mEq/L; chloride, 113 mEq/L; tCO2 7.8 mEq/L. Albuminuria and hematuria were detected. An ultrasonogram revealed enlarged kidneys with increased parenchymal echogenicity and poor corticomedullary differentiation. A renal biopsy was performed at the age of 29 days and light microscopy showed small glomeruli with various degrees of mesangial sclerosis (). The tubules were dilated with regenerative activity. Her karyotype was 46 XX. Analysis of the sequence of WT1 exon 9 revealed the presence of a heterozygous G to T base substitution, converting 396Asp to 396Tyr, and a heterozygous 395 Ser (TCC) > Ser (TCA) polymorphism (). Both parents showed normal sequence at these sites. Peritoneal dialysis was commenced with a temporary shift to hemodiafiltration because of dialysate leakage at the exit site. Sustained hypertension (120/80 mmHg) responded to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. She was maintained on total parenteral nutrition due to uncontrolled chylothorax that resulted from internal jugular vein catheterization, and the patient died at the age of six months due to multiple serious infections and failure to thrive.

The patient had a 1-year-history of chief complaints of weakness of all four extremities, weight gain and bilateral lower extremity edema. For two months prior to admission, the patient had a progressive worsening of bilateral lower extremity edema. On physical examination, the patient had body mass index (BMI) 28.6 kg/m2 and vital signs such as blood pressure 130/90 mmHg, pulse rate 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min and O2 saturation 96% in room air. In addition, the patient had pale and dry skin. Heart rate was regular and systolic murmur was heard at the apex. Breath sounds were decreased with inspiratory crackles on bilateral lung bases. The patient also had bilateral presence of non-pitting edema of the foot and ankle. On chest X-ray, the patient had cardiomegaly with perihilar congestion and blunting of both costophrenic angles. These findings are suggestive of pleural effusion (). On electrocardiographic findings, the patient had normal sinus rhythm with low voltage of limb leads, interventricular conduction delay and non-specific ST-segment and T-wave changes (). On clinical laboratory examinations, the patient showed elevated serum levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (5026 pg/mL) and normal range of cardiac enzymes. Renal functions were normal with blood urea nitrogen of 14.8 mg/dL and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. Lipid panel showed total cholesterol 231 mg/dL, triglyceride 188 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 34 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 88 mg/dL. Liver function test showed elevated serum levels of transaminases with total bilirubin 1.34 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase 402 IU/L, alanine transaminase 340 IU/L and alkaline phosphatase 44 IU/L. On complete blood counts, the patient had white blood cell counts 9260/mm3 with 56% neutrophils, hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL and platelets 190000/mm3. Serum electrolytes showed [Na+] = 120 meq/L, suggesting hyponatremia, and [K+] = 4.3 meq/L. Serum creatinine kinase was elevated (2738 U/L). On echocardiography, the patient had a dilated left ventricular cavity with a diastolic dimension of 6.1 cm, a decreased global systolic function with an ejection fraction of 16% and functional mitral regurgitation of moderate grade (). The patient had a ratio of transmitral early peak velocity (E) to septal mitral annulus velocity (E') of 13. The patient was started on loop diuretic therapy using furosemide and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) for heart failure. On day 2, the patient underwent thyroid function test. This showed that the patient had elevated serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (100 µIU/mL) (reference range: 0.5-5 µIU/mL), decreased serum levels of T3 (60 ng/dL) (reference range: 80-180 ng/dL) and decreased serum levels of free T4 (0.054 ng/dL) (reference range: 0.7-1.9 ng/dL). Furthermore, the patient underwent additional tests to reveal the cause of hypothyroidism. This showed that the patient was positive for thyroglobulin antibody but negative for anti-microsomal one. On thyroid ultrasonography, the patient had an atrophic thyroid gland with hypoechoic parenchyma with two small nodules of 5 mm and 8 mm in size in the right lobe. On Tc 99-mm radionuclide thyroid scan, there was an increased uptake in the above two small nodules. On fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the nodules, the patient had adenomatous hyperplasia on lymphocytic thyroiditis background (). These findings were suggestive of Hashimoto's thyroiditis accompanied by atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis. Based on these findings, the patient was started on thyroid hormone replacement with thyroxine. Thyroxine dose was titrated up to 50 µg/day after two weeks and then up to 100 µg/day. This was followed by the adjustment of thyroxine dose based on thyroid functions. At a 1-year follow-up, the patient had a gradual decrease in the enlarged left ventricular chamber and a normalization of the decreased left ventricular systolic functions (). Furthermore, the patient also had a normalization of clinical laboratory findings such as transaminases and creatinine kinase. Follow-up echocardiography findings are shown in . Three months after the treatment, the patient had a decrease in the BMI to 23.4 kg/m2. The patient discontinued use of loop diuretics (furosemide) but continued use of ACE inhibitor (enalapril), β-blockers (bisoprolol) and thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nWhat is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

There were multiple rib fractures (). For further evaluation, she had a chest computed tomography (CT) scan done before visiting our hospital. The chest CT revealed multiple sclerotic masses with bone destruction in both hemithoraxes (right 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 10th ribs, left 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th, and 9th ribs) of variable size (). Initially she was admitted to the pulmonology department to rule out bony metastases from a cancer of unknown origin. She had taken the bone densitometry of the L1-L4 lumbar spine by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), at the local department of gynecology 1.5 years ago. The result of bone mineral density (BMD) was 0.726 g/cm2 and the average T-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine was -2.6. The average Z-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine was -2.0. Therefore, she was taking calcium, vitamin D supplements and hormone replacement therapy for osteoporosis. She also had a conization in 2002 due to squamous cell carcinoma in situ at the uterine cervix and thereafter received a total hysterectomy in 2005 due to uterine leiomyoma. She had no alcohol drinking or smoking history. There were no abnormal findings in her family history. Also, she had no trauma history. She did not have moon face, buffalo hump, or abdominal straie. She didn't have any pain on her ribs. On the physical examination, there wasn't tenderness around fracture sites. Her height and weight were 153 cm and 53 kg, respectively, with a body mass index (BMI) of 22 kg/m2. Her waist measurement was 83 cm, and she had experienced no recent weight changes. Her blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg with a pulse of 96 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a body temperature of 36.8℃. On the blood test, the leukocyte, hemoglobin, and platelet counts were 8,900/mm3 (neutrophils 85.9%, lymphocyte 8.4%, monocyte 5.7%), 14.9 g/dL, and 184,000/µL, respectively. Fasting glucose, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine were 93 mg/dL, 4.0 g/dL, 45 IU/L, 81 IU/L, 49 IU/L, and 0.56 mg/dL, respectively. Total calcium and phosphate were 10.5 mg/dL and 3.5 mg/dL, respectively. In addition, serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was 35.6 pg/mL (normal range, 13-54 pg/mL).\nTo evaluate the patient for metastatic cancer, a bone biopsy was performed at the right 6th rib posterior arc in the pulmonology department. Also a bone scan and the bone densitometry of the L1-L4 lumbar spine and an abdominal CT were performed. Fragmented bony particles with small amounts of marrow tissue were observed in the biopsy tissue.\nThere were no cancer cells nor cytokeratin (CK)-positive epithelial cells on immunohistochemical staining. There was no cancerous lesion in abdomen CT, except a left adrenal incidentaloma, a well-marginated soft tissue mass 25 mm in diameter, was found (). On the bone scan, multi-focal increased uptake was observed in both ribs, suggesting non-traumatic micro-fractures caused by osteoporosis (). The average BMD, T-score and Z-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine was 0.761 g/cm2, -2.1 and -1.7, respectively. Therefore, an endocrine cause of osteoporotic fracture was suspected, and a hormonal study for adrenal incidentaloma was performed. Free cortisol in the urine and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid were 580.4 µg/day (normal range, 20-90 µg/day) and 12.93 mg/day (normal range, 3-15 mg/day), respectively. A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test showed that the serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone level was 1.4 pg/mL (normal <130 pg/mL), the basal cortisol was 26.3 µg/dL and the cortisol on the 3rd day was 35.4 µg/dL (normal, 3-6 µg/dL). Cortisol was not suppressed. Finally, she was diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome due to the left adrenocortical adenoma. A laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed in June 2009. A month after the laparoscopic left adrenalectomy, 24-hr urine free cortisol was checked, and was below 1.8 µg/day. A bone scan taken 1 year after the operation showed decreased multifocal uptake in the bilateral ribs () and the patient's BMD improved gradually, reaching 0.822 g/cm2 in 2012 (). Also, the average T-score and Z-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine improved, reaching -1.6 and -1.0, respectively. Currently, she is being regularly followed-up and taking calcium and vitamin D for osteopenia.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

Slit-lamp microscope showed erythema and edema of the eyelids and chemosis (Fig. a). Color fundus photograph revealed two ERD lesions temporal and superior-nasal to the optic disk (Fig. b). The presence of ERD was further confirmed by SD-OCT (spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) (Fig. c).\nSystemic laboratory tests were revealed by full blood count (WBC 10.54 × 109/L, 84% neutrophils) and assessment of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (37 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (12 mg/L). Blood cultures were performed which identified Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital computed tomography (CT) scans identified left eye proptosis and swelling of the periorbital and postbulbar soft tissue, which all led to the diagnosis of orbital cellulitis. The presence of ERD was again verified by orbital CT scans (Fig. d). However, the cause for the orbital cellulitis was not idenitfied in this patient, such as trauma, periorbital cellulitis with local spread, paranasal sinusitis, or hematogenous spread of a remote infection.\nTreatments in this patient were initiated soon after final diagnosis was made. Intravenous administration of antibiotics (cefatriaxone, 2.0 g, daily) was received, in addition to topical antibiotics (Lenofloxacin eye drops, Santen, Osaka, Japan) four times a day. The patient was closely followed up daily with routine ocular examinations. Considerable improvement of laboratory tests, including those revealed by the normalized blood test, was achieved after 1 week, when intravenous antibiotics were terminated.

Initially, her dysphagia could be alleviated within 1–3 min by drinking warm water. Six months before hospital admission (Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University), her dysphagia became more frequent (once every 2–3 weeks), lasting for up to 10 min and could not be relieved by drinking warm water. The retrosternal chest pressure was relieved by regurgitation. These episodes were associated with hypersalivation and profuse sweating. Heartburn and retrosternal chest pain were frequent. Three weeks prior to hospitalization, she was unable to tolerate any solid food orally.\nPhysical examination showed no focal abnormality. Complete blood count, liver biochemistry, electrolytes and creatinine were normal. An upper gastrointestinal barium swallow study showed typical features of achalasia, demonstrating the bird's beak sign, no barium passed into the stomach during the investigation. Endoscopy, performed after two days of fasting, showed no mucosal abnormality although there was an increased resistance passing the endoscope through the LES.\nEsophageal manometry using a 8-channel water perfused system with a Dent sleeve for LES pressure, showed high LES pressure and regular spontaneous rhythmic non-propagating contractions in the esophageal body at a frequency of 7/min, with an amplitude between 48 and 51 mm Hg (Figures , ). An initial dry swallow did not affect the contractile activity but two subsequent dry swallows decreased amplitude and frequency (Figure ). Subsequent wet swallows, using 20 ml of warm water, increased the frequency to 8/min and also increased the amplitude (Figure ). Drotaverine hydrochloride (40 mg intramuscular) was given to reduce the LES pressure; this markedly reduced the contraction frequency from 7 to 3/min without a significant effect on the amplitude; a subsequent wet swallow increased the frequency to 9/min and also increased the contraction amplitude (Figure ). Significant swallow-induced LES relaxation was still present.\nPneumatic balloon dilatation of the LES was performed uneventfully. The balloon was 35 mm in diameter, 80 mm in length, obtained from EndoFlex Germany. A small amount of blood was seen on the balloon after the dilation procedure. Omeprazole 40 mg iv daily was administered for 3 days. Thereafter the diet was advanced gradually as tolerated. By day 5, liquid meals passed down the stomach without pain.

The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.\n\nWhat is the patient's MELDA Na score?\n\nMELD Na (UNOS/OPTN): MELD(i) = [0.957 x ln(Cr) + 0.378 x ln(bilirubin) + 1.120 x ln(INR) + 0.643].

            "input": "A 43-year-old German woman was examined after incidental findings of bilateral nephrocalcinosis by ultrasound during her second pregnancy. Figure shows an ultrasound image demonstrating renal medullary nephrocalcinosis in her left kidney. Even though her recent medical history was unremarkable, the patient had claimed strong thirst and polyuria in childhood. Strong appetite for salty food was denied, even though beneficial effects after consumption of salt-rich foods were noticed. She ingested no laxatives or diuretics, nor did the patient abuse alcohol or other drugs. The patient denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, weakness, fever, night sweats, weight loss and heat intolerance. The patient is mother of two healthy daughters.\nPhysical examination was normal. The blood pressure was normotensive (136/80 mmHg), no oedema were detected. ECG was normal. Laboratory tests showed hypokalaemia (3.0 mmol/L), low-normal total serum calcium (2.31 mmol/L), hyperaldosteronism (515 ng/L, 847 ng/L) (normal range 30–340), hyperreninaemia (43.1 ng/L, 25.6 ng/L) (normal range 2.0–24.6) and increased calcium excretion in the urine [7.5 mmol/day or 0.13 mmol/kg body weight/day (normal range <6.2 mmol/day or <0.1 mmol/kg body weight/day)]. Serum sodium (139 mmol/L), chloride (104 mmol/L), magnesium (0.87 mmol/L) and phosphate (0.9 mmol/L) levels were normal. In venous blood, pH was normal, bicarbonate levels are at the high limit of normality and there seems to be respiratory compensation (venous pH 7.37, HCO3 28.2 mmol/L, pCO2 56.9 mmHg, PO2 29.4 mmHg). In arterial blood, pH was high but bicarbonate levels were normal (pH 7.498, HCO3 25.7 mmol/L, pCO2 30.5 mmHg, PO2 118 mmHg). Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa 2.3%) was increased and tubular phosphate reabsorption (80%) was determined to be in the normal range. FE of potassium (FEK 22%, 29%) was increased, whereas FE of chloride was increased (FECl 2.52%). The trans-tubular potassium gradient (TTKG 21) was high in our patient considering the presence of hypokalaemia, indicating renal potassium wasting. Serum creatinine was 1.10 mg/dL [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, MDRD) 58 mL/min], indicating mild-to-moderate CKD (Grade 3a) (2012 KDIGO guidelines). Proteinuria and albuminuria were not detected (protein <40 mg/mL, albumin <3 mg/mL; creatinine 0.4 g/L in urine). After 14 h of water deprivation, our patient had a reduced urine osmolality [392 mOsmol/kg; normal 915 ± 91 mOsmol/kg) at a plasma osmolality of 294 mOsml/kg] [], indicating that she cannot concentrate her urine well. Since antidiuretic hormone (AVP) in plasma is high [plasma copeptin [computed tomography (CT)-pro-AVP] levels 32.4 pmol/L; normal range 2.3–24.5 pmol/L], this decreased urine concentrating capacity does not have central cause (i.e. impaired AVP release by the pituitary gland), but has a renal origin.\nComputed tomography scan densitometry was unremarkable. There was no amelogenesis imperfecta []. Hypothyroidism was diagnosed earlier [anti-thyroid antibodies negative (TRAK) or with non-significant titres (TPO, Tg)] and substituted with L-thyroxin. Hyperparathyroidism [serum parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels (126 ng/L) (normal 15–65 ng/L)] was also detected earlier. Since thyroid/parathyroid ultrasound examination, computed tomography neck/thorax scan, parathyroid scintigraphy, osteodensitometry and X-rays of hands were unremarkable, the patient was initially treated with vitamin D substitution. Although this treatment resulted in a suppression of PTH levels to high-normal values, vitamin D substitution was later discontinued because of possible progression of nephrocalcinosis. The patient was treated with oral supplementation of potassium (80 mmol/day) and ramipril (10 mg/day). In the follow-up period, her serum potassium improved to a level of 3.5 mmol/L. Her serum creatinine stabilized at the level of 1.13 mg/dL (eGFR 59 mL/min) over the next 3 years of follow-up.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta ratio?\n\nDelta Ratio: delta_ratio = delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L)",

These symptoms were associated with significant arthralgia affecting her wrists and knees. There were no other associated symptoms. Her family history was negative for lipid disorders, dermatologic conditions, and chronic inflammatory conditions.\nThe physical examination revealed multiple flesh colored to slightly pink, flat-topped, smooth papules lined up in a row in the periungual skin on every finger of both hands, as well as the margin of the nares, forehead, and scalp. The musculoskeletal examination demonstrated unequivocal polyarthritis. There was swelling, loss of range of motion, and pain with movement in both elbows. There was synovial thickening and pain with flexion in both wrists. There were flexion contractures of the second and third proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands. Effusions and synovial thickening were present in both knees.\nLaboratory results showed a normal complete blood count, hepatic profile, renal profile, and lipid profile (cholesterol 128 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein 83 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 30 mg/dL, triglycerides 75 mg/dL). Lactate, uric acid, serum sterol, and urine organic acid levels (desmosterol, lathosterol, campesterol and sitosterol) were all within normal limits. ESR and CRP were within normal limits. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed no significant abnormalities. Lyme serology, anti-nuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were negative. PPD was negative.\nBilateral hand X-rays demonstrated mild diffuse osteopenia without periosteal reaction, soft tissue swelling in the digits, most striking at the base of the fingernails and a radiolucency at the base of the left third proximal phalanx. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was unremarkable. CT scan of the neck showed multiple, less than 2 cm lymph nodes. A glenohumeral joint effusion was noted as well.\nSkin biopsies were obtained from the nail fold and scalp. The histology sections showed a dome-shape lesion with dermal infiltrate composed of foamy histiocytes and a few admixed lymphocytes (fig ). Multinucleated giant cells and Touton type giant cells were not observed. There was upward migration of cells with clear, foamy, and vacuolated cytoplasm within the overlying epidermis. PAS stains were negative for glycogen deposition and fungal organisms. AFB stains were negative. Immunostaining with CD68 was positive, and CD1a stained only a few intraepidermal and rare dermal cells. Factor XIIIa stained a few scattered cells. These biopsies where read by multiple pathologists as consistent with papular xanthoma. Additional biopsies of synovium and additional skin nodule both showed foamy histiocytes with scattered lymphocytes arranged in sheets. Cytoplasm ranged from clear to bubbly to finely granular. CD68 and lysozyme stained strongly positive in histiocytes. Formal evaluation of the patient by an ophthalmologist, oncologist, and metabolic specialist revealed no additional findings.\nThe child was diagnosed with MRH based on her clinical presentation, even though histopathology was not classic for this disorder, and followed in pediatric rheumatology clinic. She was started on naproxen without major improvement in the joint complaints; methotrexate was then added at a dose of 5 mg (0.4 mg/kg) by mouth once a week and later increased to 7.5 mg (0.6 mg/kg) subcutaneously once a week without major improvement. Hydroxychloroquine 75 mg (6.25 mg/kg) by mouth per day was added. Subcutaneous nodules of about 2 × 1 × 2 cm were noted on the upper portion her arms bilaterally in the region of the axilla and diagnosed as synovial cysts by ultrasound. X ray of the shoulders revealed subtendinous erosion of bone in the humerus and distal clavicle remodeling (fig ). Oral prednisone 1.7 mg/kg/day was started, and there was almost complete resolution of the xanthomatous lesions and moderate improvement in her arthritis. Prednisone was tapered to 1 mg/kg.\nHowever, she continued to have multiple joint effusions and decreased range of motion in her PIP joints. Therefore, etanercept was added at a dose of 20 mg (1.25 mg/kg) subcutaneously every week. Methotrexate was increased to 12.5 mg (0.8 mg/kg). She had a partial initial response to etanercept with some improvement in the range of motion of her MCP's and wrists. However, after 3 months on etanercept, the patient had significant ongoing polyarthritis, so the etanercept dose was increased to 25 mg (1.5 mg/kg), and methotrexate was increased to 15 mg (0.9 mg/kg). As her prednisone was tapered very slowly, a few tiny xanthomatous lesions reappeared. Due to worsening polyarthritis, etanercept was discontinued, and infliximab was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously. After 2 infusions given 2 weeks apart, the patient was noted to have improvement with resolution of multiple joint effusions and improved range of motion. In addition, all xanthomas disappeared. The infliximab infusions were continued every 4 weeks. Methotrexate was continued at 0.9 mg/kg subcutaneously per week. Prednisone was tapered further, but patient developed recurrent polyarthritis and new xanthomas over her fingers. Unfortunately, her synovitis did not improve further when infliximab was increased to 20 mg/kg.\n\nWhat is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL.

A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().\nA peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications.

The rest of the physical examination showed no other significant changes.\nInitial laboratory evaluation revealed: hemoglobin (Hb) 9.7 g/L, hematocrit (Ht) 28.2%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 82.7 fl, white blood count (WBC) 3.02 × 109/L, neutrophils: 2.3 × 109/L, lymphocytes: 0.5 × 109/L, platelets: 39 × 109/L, Na++ 127 mEq/L, K+ 4.3 mEq/L, total Ca++ 9.3 mg/L, P 3.1 mg/L, creatinine 1.84 mg/dL, BUN 122 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 648 U/L, and C-protein reactive (CPR) 58.1 mg/L. Hepatic profile showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 258 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 213 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 386 U/L, gamma GT 473 U/L, total bilirubin: 2.95 mg dL (direct bilirubin [DB]: 2.29 /indirect bilirubin [IB]: 0.66), albumin 2.4 g/dL, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR): 1.27, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratio = 1.23. Laboratory evolution throughout hospitalization is summarized in Table .\nIn the emergency department, peripheral blood and urine cultures were collected and intravenous saline fluid and ceftriaxone was administered for treatment of supposed infectious etiologies. After initial measurements, blood pressure was normalized and the patient was stabilized. In his previous medical history, he had systemic arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure caused by recurrent nephrolithiasis. He used carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, spironolactone 25 mg once daily, ivabradine 5 mg twice daily, AAS 100 mg daily, and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily.\nThe patient had external laboratory tests showing 0.8 g/dL of monoclonal protein, IgA kappa paraprotein at serum immunofixation, serum IgA of 1038 mg/dL (70–400 mg/dL), and β2 microglobulin of 20.61 mg/L (0.8–2.2 mg/L). Bone marrow biopsy was hypercellular with monoclonal plasma cell proliferation CD56 (+), kappa light chain restriction, representing 30% of the total nucleated cells. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) Durie Salmon IIIA, ISS III was established in this moment.\nChest, abdomen, and pelvic computerized tomography (CT) revealed multiple lymphadenopathies up to 5.0 cm and splenomegaly. Positron emission CT with 18-fluoro deoxyglucose (18-FDG-PETCT) showed multiple lymphadenopathies in the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with SUVmax 12.0, liver FDG uptake 15.8 (SUVmax), and 16.4 cm splenomegaly with 15.8 spleen FDG uptake (Fig. ). Echocardiography was negative for endocarditis.\nThere was negativity for viral hepatitis B and C serology as well as for HIV, HTLV1, chickenpox, toxoplasmosis, herpes, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, enterovirus, paraecovirus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Blood cultures were negative. As the patient persisted with fever, ceftriaxone introduced at admission was replaced by Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Teicoplanin. However, the patient evolved quickly with multiorgan dysfunction characterized by liver and renal failure, LDH increase, and coagulopathy characterized by prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and factor V reduction keeping factor VIII level between the normal range values (Table ).\nAs the clinician suspected of concurrent HLH further tests showed serum ferritin level of 47.502 ng/mL (30–400 ng/mL) and slight elevation of triglycerides. A new bone marrow aspiration confirmed the presence of 21.6% of aberrant plasma cells with significant macrophage activity with several haemophagocytosis pictures (Fig. ). Immunophenotyping demonstrated 4.9% of anomalous and monoclonal plasma cells expressing CD45dim, CD19partial, CD38bright, CD138bright, CD56dim, CD117dim, and kappa light chain restriction in cytoplasm. Thereafter, the patient was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit and pulse therapy with methylprednisolone 1 g/d for 3 days was administered to control HLH. Afterwards the patient received cyclophosphamide at dose of 500 mg once weekly and dexamethasone 20 mg once daily D1–D4 as anti-multiple myeloma treatment. We were not able to investigate lymphadenopathy because the patient became soon hemodynamically unstable, requiring mechanical ventilation support and renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis. Unfortunately, the patient died 15 days after hospitalization.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?\n\nCKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate: GFR = 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coefficient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1.

            "input": "The patient was an 82-year-old woman who had a 3-year history of leg cramps and first had chest tightness for two years. She had been treated for ischemic cardiomyopathy with triple vessel disease at another hospital, but had been hospitalized for heart failure 12 times in the last two years. Echocardiography that was performed in the hospital reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. The patient had a history of left thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer at the age of 67 years with no subsequent recurrence. Comorbidities included angina pectoris, chronic heart failure, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and gastric ulcer (gastrointestinal bleeding with antithrombotic drugs). Her usual medications were tolvaptan 7.5 mg, azosemide 60 mg, furosemide 60 mg, rabeprazole 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, bisoprolol 0.625 mg, amiodarone 50 mg, levothyroxine sodium 50 μg, cremedin 6 g, and sodium ferrous citrate 100 mg. Her ability to perform activities of daily living was good, and there was no history of alcohol drinking, smoking, or allergy. She noticed shortness of breath and chest discomfort when she was about to go to the restroom in the morning, and was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of our hospital.\nPhysical findings on admission were: height, 153 cm; weight, 53 kg; body mass index, 22.6 kg/m2; body temperature, 36.9℃; blood pressure, 155/94 mmHg; heart rate, 83/min and regular; respiratory rate, 22/min; and SpO2, 98% (O2, 6 L). The palpebral conjunctiva was not pale, and jugular venous distention was observed. There were coarse crackles in both lung fields and no murmurs. There was no peripheral coldness in the limbs and lower leg edema was observed. A 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 71 beats/min, no ST elevation, and a negative T wave in leads V3-6 (Figure ). The corrected QT interval (QTc) was prolonged by 556 ms.\nChest radiography showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 70%, indicating cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, and bilateral pleural effusion (Figure ).\nEchocardiography showed akinesis mainly at the apex and diffuse hypokinesis at the base, showing systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 15%. The blood tests revealed decreased renal function with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 88 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.26 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 11.1 mL/min/BSA.The serum albumin level was 3.3 g/dL and serum potassium level was 4.5 mmol/L. Creatine kinase (CK) was slightly elevated at 191 U/L, but the creatine kinase-myocardial band (2.8 ng/mL) and troponin I (0.02 ng/mL) levels were not elevated. The level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 802.7 pg/mL. A diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure was made, and treatment with oxygen and diuretics (furosemide 20mg) was started. The patient responded well and urine volumes in the initial three hours were 400 mL; however, 12 hours after admission, she experienced sudden onset chest pain and pain radiating to the neck. Consciousness at the time of the attack was clear, systolic blood pressure was 120 mmHg, heart rate was 80/min with sinus rhythm, and SpO2 was 89% (O2 10 L). The pain extended to the extremities. The 12-lead ECG at the time of the attack was not significantly different from that at the time of admission (Figure ). Chest radiography showed worsening pulmonary congestion (Figure ). Echocardiography and blood sampling showed no marked change from that on admission, no increase in cardiac enzymes, and no findings strongly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. When respiratory management by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was continued, symptoms improved after approximately one hour. Although serum calcium and magnesium levels were not measured at the time of admission, additional examinations revealed hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 4.9 mg/dL and hypomagnesemia with a magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL. The phosphorus level was 6.3 mg/dL. It was considered that the symptoms were due to a tetanic seizure. The cause of hypocalcemia was thought to be chronic kidney disease (CKD) because parathyroid function, as reflected by intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), was preserved (122.7 pg/mL) despite prior operation on the thyroid gland. Since the level of consciousness and symptoms did not deteriorate, calcium correction was started by oral administration while magnesium was corrected by drip infusion. The patient rapidly responded to intravenous infusion of magnesium and oral administration of calcium and vitamin D preparations. Serum calcium normalized on day 6 of hospitalization and the corrected calcium level was 9.1 mg/dL at the time of discharge. The QTc on ECG decreased from 556 to 491 ms (Figure ). The electrolyte abnormality improved without subsequent recurrence of tetany. The LVEF by echocardiography improved from 15% to 27% at the time of discharge. Although coronary angiography was not performed because of renal dysfunction, the LV contraction failure may have been affected by hypocalcemia. Her heart failure was well controlled with tolvaptan 15 mg, azosemide 90 mg, furosemide 20 mg and and bisoprolol 0.625 mg (Figure ), and she left hospital on the 13th day of hospitalization.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

            "input": "The 29-year-old male patient is the first child of healthy unrelated Lithuanian parents. The proband was born at full term. Psychomotor development of the proband was delayed. He attended a regular school until the age of 16 years and was further educated in a professional school. An IQ evaluation at the age of 20 showed a score of 69. At his latest evaluation at the age of 29 years, his height was 164 cm, his weight was 85 kg, his BMI was 31 kg/m2, and the circumference of his head was 60 cm (90 centile). Other anthropometric measurements were thus: total upper limb length of 66 cm, upper arm length of 35 cm, forearm length of 25 cm, hand length of 15 cm, palm length of 8.5 cm, middle finger length of 6.5 cm, total lower limb length of 87 cm on the left and 86 cm on the right, thigh length of 42 cm on both sides, calf length of 45 cm on the left and 44 cm on the right, and feet length of 23 cm. The patient has minor facial anomalies (Fig. ), including flat face, sloping forehead with prominent supraorbital ridges, sparse and broad brows, depressed nasal ridge, short nose, long philtrum, and malar hypoplasia. Additionally, dental malocclusion, parodontosis, red and sparse scalp hair, male pattern baldness, and short neck are apparent. The patient is overweight and has limited elbow extension, brachydactyly of both hands, short rectangular nails, a single palmar crease, valgus deformation of the knees, brachydactyly of toes II–V of both feet, short rectangular toenails, and relative hyperplasia of the halluces (Fig. ). The patient complained of premature tiredness, excessive perspiration, and poor fine motor function. He has primary arterial hypertension, and a cardiac ultrasound showed a mitral valve prolapse. An ophthalmological examination revealed hypermetropia. Hormonal screening was remarkable for elevated levels of serum PTH (13.9 pmol/l (n = 1.6–7.3 pmol/l)) and somatotropin (12.2 mIU/l (n < 9.0 mIU/l)). Elevated PTH levels were probably secondary to vit. D deficiency. TSH, T3, T4, FSH, LH, testosterone, cortisole and ACTH were within normal limits. 25-OH vitamin D was 51.4 nmol/l (n = 75–100 nmol/l), serum calcium was 2.58 mmol/l (n = 2.10–2.55 mmol/l), serum phosphorus 0.82 mmol/l (n = 0.74–1.52 mmol/l), serum glucose was 6.09 mmol/l (n = 4.2–6.1 mmol/l). The glucose tolerance test was normal. The ultrasound of the thyroid gland and MRI scan of the hypophyseal gland showed no abnormalities. The X-ray of the hands showed very short and broad tubular bones. Metacarpals II–V are proximally pointed. Coning of phalanges are present in the middle and proximal phalanges of the second to fifth fingers. There is relative sparing of the thumb. The metatarsal bones and phalanges are markedly shortened and there is disproportionate plumpness of the tubular bones of the hallux (Fig. ). Considering all clinical features and physical examination results, the diagnosis of acrodysostis type 2 was assigned for our proband.\nTo identify DNA sequence variants in the gene PDE4D and analyze segregation, Sanger sequencing was conducted for the proband and his parents. Phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction method was used to isolate genomic DNA from peripheral blood of all three patients. The PDE4D exons 2, 3, 6, 7, 13, 15 were amplified by PCR with specific primers (designed using the Primer Blast software, NCBI, USA) and sequenced in the DNA sample of the proband. PDE4D exon 2 was amplified and sequenced in the parents’ DNA samples to investigate inheritance pattern of the identified variant. Target PCR products from all three individuals were sequenced with BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the capillary electrophoresis was carried out with ABI3130xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, USA). Sanger sequencing results were analysed with Sequence Analysis v5.1 software (Applied Biosystems, USA). The reference sequence of the PDE4D gene (NCBI: NM_001104631.2) was used for aligning the obtained sequences. Primers and PCR conditions are available from the authors upon request. The pathogenicity of identified DNA sequence variant was evaluated by using several bioinformatics tools: SIFT (), PolyPhen-2 (), MutationTaster2 (), PROVEAN (). PDE4D nucleotide sequence conservation analysis was performed using multiple sequence alignment tool Clustal Omega (EMBL-EBI, ).\nHeterozygous missense variant NM_001104631.2:c.581G > C (NP_001098101.1:p.(Arg194Pro)) located in exon 2 of the gene PDE4D was detected in the proband’s DNA sample by Sanger sequencing. Family segregation analysis of the identified variant revealed it’s de novo occurrence. Different in silico tools predicted this variant to be likely pathogenic: SIFT damaging (0,00), PolyPhen-2 (0,99), MutationTaster2 disease causing (0,99), PROVEAN deleterious (− 5,60). The pathogenicity of detected variant was classified according to the guidelines proposed by American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics [].\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

He had a history of long-standing uncontrolled type 2 diabetes treated irregularly with insulin and metformin (HbA1c 10.1%), with no known microvascular or macrovascular complications. He had no history of alcohol consumption and twenty-four hours earlier he referred nocturia, polyuria and polydipsia. On the day of admission, while asleep, he suddenly developed three consecutive episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures along with urinary sphincter loss and subsequent postictal state.\nOn physical examination he was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute, temperature 36.5°C, and room-air oxygen saturation of 98%. His body mass index was 32.2. Mucous membranes were remarkably dry. The patient was lethargic and had a Glasgow coma scale of 11/15, muscle strength was 4/5 in both lower extremities, and deep tendon reflexes were diminished. Cranial nerves were normal, sensitivity was preserved, and meningeal signs and primitive reflexes were absent. Due to the patient status cerebellum function could not be evaluated. Finger-stick glucose could not be recorded due to high blood glucose levels and venous blood gas analysis reported pH 7.36, PCO2 42 mmHg, PO2 32 mmHg, lactate 1.2 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 23.7 mEq/L. Urinary and plasma ketones were negative. Hydration with intravenous normal saline solution at 500 mL/h and an insulin infusion at 0.14 U/kg were started. Plasma glucose was 838 mg/dL (46.5 mmol/L), blood nitrogen urea 21 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL with a MDRD calculated glomerular filtration rate of 71 mL/min, serum sodium 133 mmol/L, and chlorine 89 mmol/L. Calcium, potassium, phosphorous, magnesium, hemoglobin, white blood count, and platelets were all within normal limits. Serum albumin was 2.1 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase 192 UI/L, alanine aminotransferase 19 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 21 U/L, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, and serum osmolality 320 mOsm/kg ().\nHead computed tomography, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray were normal. The patient after 24 hours of treatment continued with altered mental status and paraparesis progressed (3/5). Plasma glucose was lowered down carefully at a rate of 30–40 mg/dL/hr and was within 200–300 mg/dL []. Serum osmolality dropped down to 305 mOsm/Kg (). Twenty-four hours after admission a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered and revealed increased signal intensity on T2-weighted FLAIR images with restricted diffusion in the medulla and central pons (). Mammillary bodies, thalamus, third ventricle, and both hemispheres were respected. Lumbar puncture was normal, electroencephalogram showed a nonspecific wave activity, and urinary and serum toxicology panel were negative. During all his admission serum sodium was documented to be within normal range. ODS was diagnosed and aggressive supportive therapy was started. During the next 3 weeks the patient progressively regained consciousness and muscle strength and was able to feed himself.

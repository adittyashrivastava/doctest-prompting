Q: A 70-year-old male presented with dizziness to the emergency department. His wife reports that he has been very compliant with his antihypertensive medication but over the last few days, he has been feeling progressively weak and off balance. It is revealed that he had a recent change in his medication regimen. On entering the room, he is sitting on the bed, alert, with eyes open and actively looking around. He immediately makes eye contact when acknowledged and is oriented to situation. He was able to recognize his treating physician and the emergency ward, spontaneously stating that he is in the hospital for dizziness. During neurological examination, he follows two step commands. His blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 58 bpm. Blood samples are taken for laboratory analysis, including a full blood count, renal function, electrolytes, and thyroid function tests. An EKG is ordered to rule out arrhythmias as the cause of his symptoms.

What is the patient's Glasgow Coma Score?

Calculate Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) by summing the results of the following rules:
    Best Eye Response: Spontaneously = +4 points, To verbal command = +3 points, To pain = +2 points, No eye opening = +1 point
    Best Verbal Response: Oriented = +5 points, Confused = +4 points, Inappropriate words = +3 points, Incomprehensible sounds = +2 points, No verbal response = +1 point
    Best Motor Response: Obeys commands = +6 points, Localizes pain = +5 points, Withdrawal from pain = +4 points, Flexion to pain = +3 points, Extension to pain = +2 points, No motor response = +1 point"
A: Let's think step by step.
To calculate a patient's Glasgow Coma Score, we need to evaluate each rule in order, summing up their values.
First, we set our base value to 0.
Next, we evaluate best eye response. According to the patient note, the patient immediately makes eye contact and is actively looking around. This means that the answer to this rule is 'Spontaneously', which is worth 4 points. We add this to our current value of 0, and get a total of 4.
Next, we evaluate best verbal response. According to the patient note, the patient is oriented to the situation. This means that the answer to the this rule is 'Oriented', which is worth 5 points. We add this to our current value of 4, and get a total of 9.
Next, we evaluate best motor response. According to the patient note, the patient can follow two step commands. This means that the answer to this rule is 'Obeys commands', which is worth 6 points. We add this to our current value of 9, and get a total of 15.
We've checked all of the rules, which means our current value of 15 is the patient's Glasgow Coma Score.
Final answer: 15

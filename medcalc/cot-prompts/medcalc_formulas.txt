Q: We describe the case of a 70-year-old woman who developed sudden-onset vertical separation of images. This occurred only when she specifically gazed at a distance. For example, when she looked at a plant, she saw a double image that was completely vertically separated, without overlap. The bottom image was blurry and with color but of a similar size. It appeared ghostly and almost transparent. She could almost see through it; it was diaphanous. However, it did not disappear with either eye closed. The blurry second-bottom image disappeared only with the closure of both eyes or by looking away from the object. Hence, there was no evidence of palinopsia or bona fide diplopia. This phenomenon occurred for both stationary and moving objects. A moving truck was experienced as two vertically separated images, with the bottom image described as blurry. She knew that the bottom duplicated image was not real. The duplicated image was of the same size and receded as she approached it, as demonstrated by the patient's own original rendition (Figure ).
She denied any visual field loss or scotoma. The color perception was preserved. She denied photopsia, micropsia, macropsia, or metamorphopsia. Visual acuity was not diminished, and she was still able to read and write with ease. She denied a headache or weakness of the arms or legs. She saw an ophthalmologist who noted full ocular motion without any subtle ophthalmoparesis on double Maddox rod testing.
Her past medical history was significant for asthma and ulcerative colitis. Her medications included azathioprine, lansoprazole, mesalamine, and montelukast. Her mom had coronary artery disease and her dad had cerebrovascular disease. She was a non-smoker.
On examination, her blood pressure (BP) was 150/92 with a pulse of 71, which was regular. Her height is five feet with a weight of 185 pounds and a body mass index (BMI) of 36.1. The precordial examination was negative for a murmur and carotid bruits were absent in both internal carotid arteries. Her neurologic examination was non-revealing. Her gait station, cadence, and tandem walking were normal. Her cranial nerve examination was entirely normal. Specifically, the ocular motion was full without strabismus with a cover/uncover test and an alternate eye cover test. Accommodation was preserved without pupillary asymmetry, and visual field confrontation was normal. We were careful not to miss visual field neglect by sequential hemifield visual confrontation followed by simultaneous double hemifield confrontation. The rest of the cranial nerve function was normal. Visuomotor praxis was preserved with pantomime. No limb-kinetic or ideomotor apraxia was noted with coin deftness and transitive motor acts respectively. Ishihara plate color testing was normal. Power function was normal throughout and graded at 5/5 with the Medical Research Council (MRC) grading. Sensory examination was normal to graphesthesia and stereognosis in both hands. And deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and lively in the arms and legs. No dysmetria or intention tremor was noted in the arms. Heel to shin motion was normal in the legs bilaterally.
A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain shows a diffusion-weighted image (DWI) hyperintensity involving the left mesial occipital lobe; striate cortex, V1, spilling over into the adjacent visual association cortex, V2, indicating an ischemic infarct (Figure ).
There was a corresponding hypointensity on gradient echo imaging (GRE) in the region of V2 (Figure ).
A carotid duplex scan was normal. A transcranial Doppler (TCD) with a two Megahertz crystal with the insonation of temporal, transorbital, and sub-occipital windows bilaterally showed monophasic waveforms with no high-velocity jets, which was normal. Due to the embolic nature of the ischemic infarct and a normal event monitor, a cardiac loop monitor was implanted to rule out paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. A transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study did not reveal a patent foramen ovale or any evidence of cardiac vegetations or intra-cavitary thrombus. The automated Humphrey visual field test showed a subtle and patchy incongruous right homonymous hemianopia (Figure ); the patient herself did not notice any visual field deficits.
The patient was defaulted to 81 milligrams (mg) of aspirin daily.

What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?

Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): MAP = 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure)
A: Let's think step by step.
To calculate a patient's mean arterial pressure, or MAP, we need to know their diastolic blood pressure and their systolic blood pressure.
According to the patient note, the patient's blood pressure is 150/92. This means that her systolic blood pressure is 150 mmHg and her diastolic blood pressure is 92 mmHg.
We can now substitute these values into the formula, getting MAP = 2/3 * 92 mmHg + 1/3 * 150 mmHg.
Next, we solve the formula, following PEMDAS.
The formula has no parentheses and no exponents, so we start with multiplication. 2/3 * 92 mmHg = 61.333 mmHg, and 1/3 * 150 mmHg = 50 mmHg. Substituting these values, we can simplify the formula down to MAP = 61.333 mmHg + 50 mmHg.
Next we add the values, getting a result of MAP = 111.333 mmHg.
We've solved the equation and found that the patient's mean arterial pressure is 111.333 mmHg.
Final answer: 111.333

Q: Patient has a heart rate of 75 bpm and a QT interval of 330 msec.

Using the Bazett Formula for corrected QT interval, what is the patient's corrected QT interval in msec?

QTc Bazett Calculator: QTc = QT interval / √ (RR interval)
A: Let's think step by step.
To calculate a patient's corrected QT interval using the Bazett Calculator, we need to know both their QT interval and their RR interval. However, we aren't given their RR interval, so we need to find it.
The formula to find an RR interval is RR interval = 60/(heart rate). According to the patient note, the patient has a heart rate of 75 bpm.
To find the patient's RR interval, we substitute their heart rate into the at formula, getting RR interval = 60/75. 60/75 is equal to 0.8, so the patient's RR interval is 0.8.
We now have what we need to use the Bazett Calculator. According to the patient note, the patient's QT interval is 330 msec, and we know that their RR interval is 0.8. Substituting these values into the Bazett Calculator, we get QTc = 330 msec / √ (0.8).
Next, we solve the formula, using PEMDAS. The formula has no parentheses, but a square root is an exponent as it is equivalent to its contents raised to the power of 1/2. The square root of 0.8 is 0.894, so we substitute this value into the equation, getting QTc = 330 msec / 0.894.
Next, we divide the values, getting a result of QTc = 368.951 msec.
We've solved the equation and found that according to the Bazett formula for corrected QT interval, the patient's corrected QT interval is 368.951 msec.
Final answer: 368.951

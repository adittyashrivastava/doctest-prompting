Consider the program fragment below.  This program fragament is
incomplete, with key parts of the implementation hidden, by
replacing them with "..." markers.

PROGRAM:
```python
{partial_program}
```

QUESTION: Predict what the output of the program above will be, given
the input shown below.  You must simulate the COMPLETE execution trace
showing ALL function calls and their outputs step by step.

For each mocked function call (functions decorated with @mock.proxymock, 
@mock.dictmock, etc.), show:
1. The function name and arguments being called
2. The return value from that function

Show the execution in this format:
```
function_name(arg1, arg2, ...) -> return_value
```

Then show any print statements or final outputs.

Respond with the FULL simulation trace including all intermediate steps,
function calls, and outputs. Do NOT skip any function calls or intermediate results.

```
>>> {task_name}({input_str})
```

For each mocked function call (functions decorated with @mock.proxymock,

Show the execution in this format:

Then show any print statements or final outputs.

Respond with the FULL simulation trace including all intermediate steps,

INPUT1 = """We present an 85-year-old male with a past medical history of obesity, type two diabetes, atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage three, and coronary artery disease. The patient had a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) four weeks before the current admission, requiring a drug-eluting stent (DES) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He also had a history of significant gastrointestinal bleed in the past month, for which apixaban was stopped. The patient was admitted to our hospital with worsening shortness of breath and found to have bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. He was afebrile and did not have any symptoms of pneumonia. The patient was started on IV furosemide and had an initial diagnostic, small-bore, ultrasound-guided tap from the right pleural effusion that was uneventful and yielded straw-colored 1000 mL of fluid. The pleural fluid analysis was mildly exudative based on Light's lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) criteria, but cytology was negative as well as Gram stain, bacterial, and fungal cultures. Autoimmune screening, including anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and extractable nuclear antigen (ENA), was negative. In anticipation of a potential repeat pleural tap, the patient's aspirin was stopped. One week later, the patient was getting more short of breath, and chest X-ray revealed recurrent bilateral effusions worse on the right side. Echocardiogram showed features of diastolic dysfunction, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% and no significant valvular disease. Arterial blood gas (ABG) was suggestive of hypercapnic respiratory failure; thus, he was started on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and shifted to the ICU. He underwent a second, uneventful pleural tap on the right side, that yielded 1500 mL of straw-colored fluid. Analysis again showed an exudate with negative bacterial, fungal cultures, and cytology. CT scan of the chest showed basal atelectasis with significant pleural effusions, no lung masses, or lymph nodes enlargement (Figure ). The patient was transferred to the step-down unit, completed a 10-day course of antibiotics for possible community-acquired pneumonia, although sputum and blood cultures remained negative. One week later, the patient again clinically deteriorated and was admitted to ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure and worsening pleural effusions. He initially required continuous bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation until he stabilized. He had a third, right-sided thoracocentesis under ultrasound-guidance from a posterior approach, atraumatic, and yielded 1500 mL of clear thin yellow fluid. The patient had a follow-up chest X-ray 20 min later that showed improvement in the previously seen right-sided pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. However, two hours later, the patient was suddenly getting sweaty, tachypneic, lethargic while on BiPAP. His blood pressure (BP) was reading 60/40 mmHg, heart rate was dropping to 40 bpm, and he was less responsive. There was minimal air entry on auscultating the right chest with dullness to percussion, and no signs of any pain or tenderness. ABG showed hypoxia and a stable PCO2 level. Immediate chest X-ray showed a new 3.5 cm hemothorax on the right side (Figure ).
He was given 1 L of IV fluids, norepinephrine for BP support, and an urgent right-sided IC surgical drain was inserted, which immediately drained 1.7 L of blood.
The patient had a central line insertion, and three units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfused. Repeat hemoglobin after the second transfused unit was still below baseline at 6 g/L (from 8 g/L). He clinically started to improve after the hemothorax drainage, was more responsive, and pressor requirement was decreased. Overnight he received two units of platelets, and clopidogrel was stopped. The next day, the IC surgical drain still had around 800 mL output of serosanguinous fluid, but he was clinically back to his baseline as before this event. CT scan of the chest with IV contrast did not show any active bleeding into the pleural space but showed complex right-sided effusion. The IR team performed IC arteries angiogram to diagnose the site of the injured vessel. That was done within 24 h of the event and was negative. The cardiothoracic surgery team was consulted for possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure in the right pleural space. The patient continued to improve, and after a few days we removed the surgical drain, and transferred him out to the step-down unit with cardiothoracic surgical team following up on his care.

What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?

Calculate CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk by summing the results of the following rules:
Age: < 65 years = 0 points, 65-74 years = +1 point, ≥ 75 years = +2 points
Sex: Female = +1 point, Male = 0 points
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) history: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
Hypertension history: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
Stroke, Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), or Thromboembolism history: No = 0 points, Yes = +2 points
Vascular disease history (previous myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
Diabetes history: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point"""

Correctly close a Dyck-n word.

When you give your answer, follow the format of the examples below
carefully.  In particular, you MUST end your answer with the line like
'Final answer: xxx' where xxx is the completion of the sequence.


Q: Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: [ { [
A: Let's think step by step.
We should process each input one by one and keep track of the stack configuration.
0: empty stack
1: [ ; stack: [
2: { ; stack: [ {

Now, we have reached the end. The final stack is "[ { [".
We will need to pop out "[", "{", "[" one by one in that order.
So, we need "]", "}", "]". So the answer is ] } ].

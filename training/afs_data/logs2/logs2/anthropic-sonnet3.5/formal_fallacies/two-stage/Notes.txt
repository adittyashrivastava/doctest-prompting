Logs for a two-stage approach:

(1) convert everything in dev to CNF => tocnf-dtp-dev.log
     
     % time py run_eval2.py --hi 30 formal_fallacies --variant _2cnf > ff_cnf.log

(2) run resolution refutation on each derived CNF

    % py reason_from_cnf.py

 => Final totals: total=30 correct=10 errors={'syntax': 3, 'cnf': 2} ys={'valid': 19, 'invalid': 11}

 = 3 syntax errors (python can't eval the supposed CNF)
   2 cases of non-CNF generated
   10/15 on the remaining cases
